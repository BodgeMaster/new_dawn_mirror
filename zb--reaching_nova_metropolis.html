  &lt;Reaching Nova Metropolis&gt;
</h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Good morning, Annie! Pancakes are ready.</span>
  <br />
  Jack takes his hand off her shoulder. She <span class="comment">st&uuml;tzt
  sich hoch</span> and looks around in confusion. James is driving the bus
  on a surprisingly very intact highway though a seemingly endless desert.
  <span class="comment">might benefit from a description of said desert
  </span> Yesterday&apos;s mountains are still visible in the far distance
  behind them. Jack goes to wake up Michelle, then he tells James who pulls
  over onto the side of the highway and stops the bus. The engine goes
  quiet.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="comment">Annie gets up, they sit down around a table
  and start to eat. Also, a mention of what the dog is up to...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">So when are we gonna reach the &lt;mining
  company&gt; pit?</span>, Michelle asks.<br />
  Jack looks at James. James tilts his head slightly and shrugs.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Like two hours ago?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You&apos;re kidding.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Didn&apos;t wanna wake you up.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhh...</span> Michelle is at a loss for words.
  <br />
  James grins.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t drive from
  here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Can&apos;t even be mad... Wait, doesn&apos;t
  that mean that we&apos;re way ahead of time?</span><br />
  James shrugs again, this time holding up his hands. She turns to Jack:
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">How much ahead are we?</span><br />
  He glances at his watch.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">About three hours - but if you&apos;re as
  lucky as James, we&apos;ll be even more ahead by the time we arrive. The
  wind has favored us so far.</span><br />
  Annie chimes in: <span class="quote speech">You didn&apos;t sleep, did
  you?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sleep is overrated anyway - but, if you allow
  it, I&apos;ll be going to sleep very soon.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section?
</p>
<p>
  The four do quick work of the dishes. Annie washes them, Jack rinses them
  off in a bowl of clean water, James dries them, and Michelle puts them
  away. Jack goes to the back of the bus to sleep. The others go to the
  front.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle sits down in the driver&apos;s seat.<br />
  James yawns. <span class="quote speech">Now that I&apos;m thinking about
  it, taking a nap sounds very entising... <span class="comment">Is that
  how you spell that?</span></span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, you&apos;ve ...</span> Michelle goes to
  turn the key but nothing happens. She stops mid-sentence.<br />
  James says: <span class="quote speech"> Oh, that&apos;s been a problem.
  Can you open the door for a sec?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sure</span>, she replies with a tone of
  bewilderment in her voice.<br />
  James grabs a jumper cable and heads outside. They hear him opening some
  panel in the back of the bus followed by arcing noises. The engine begins
  to turn over. Michelle turns the key again. Finally, the engine starts
  running. James slams the panel shut and returns.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As I was about to say: You&apos;ve definitely
  earned that nap. Thanks for driving part of my
  <span class="comment">shift</span>.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Still considering it...</span><br />
  The engine roars as Michelle sets the bus in motion again.
  <span class="comment">Something is missing here. Idk.</span>
