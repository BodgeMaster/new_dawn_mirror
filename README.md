# New Dawn

These are the files for a ... book? story? I'm writing.
Not really sure what to call it. It's a website.

You can read it here: https://book.lostcave.ddnss.de/
If that doesn't work for you, there is a mirror on GitHub: https://bodgemaster.github.io/new_dawn_mirror/

If you want to read it offline, you can `git clone` this (or just download
the files).

On Linux / any Unix system with bash installed, run `./deployment-script`
to build the index.html. On other systems, I guess you will be missing the
landing page offline.
