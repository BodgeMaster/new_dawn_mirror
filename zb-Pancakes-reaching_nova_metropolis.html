<h1>
  Pancakes
</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Good morning, Annie! Pancakes are ready.</span>
  <br />
  Jack takes his hand off her shoulder. She pushes herself up from
  her bed and looks around in confusion. James is driving the bus on
  a surprisingly very intact highway through a seemingly endless landscape
  of sand and sparse vegetation. The sun is already high in the sky and
  yesterday&apos;s mountains are in the distance far behind them. Jack goes
  to wake up Michelle, then he tells James who stops the bus and turns off
  the engine.
</p>
<p>
  Annie swings her legs out of bed and sits up. She stretches and yawns,
  gets up, and shuffles over to the table. Jack puts a large plate with
  a pile of pancakes in the center and grabs plates for everyone.
  He also places a few jars on the table:
  Honey, Chocco <span class="comment">TODO: Add an advert for Chocco
  somewhere earlier in the story. It&apos;s the in-universe equivalent
  of Nutella.</span>, and cinnamon sugar. James gets up from the driver's
  seat and Dora follows him, wagging her tail. They all sit down around
  the table, including Dora who sits on the floor and gives them big puppy
  eyes.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Dora, down.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Good girl!</span>
</p>
<p>
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">So when are we gonna reach
  the <span class="comment">mining company</span> pit?</span><br />
  Jack looks at James. James tilts his head slightly and shrugs.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Like five hours ago?</span><br />
  <!-- Jack's shift until midnight, James' shift until 6AM, plan was for
  Michelle's shift to start at the pit, it is now 9AM. -->
  <span class="quote speech">You&apos;re kidding.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Didn&apos;t wanna wake you up.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhh...</span> Michelle is at a loss for words.
  <br />
  James grins.<br />
  She says: <span class="quote speech">Can&apos;t even be mad... But
  doesn&apos;t that mean that we&apos;re way ahead of time?</span><br />
  James shrugs again.<br />
  Jack glances at his watch and says: <span class="quote speech">About
  two and a half hours give or take. With a bit of luck, we&apos;ll be
  even more ahead when we arrive. We&apos;ve had some quite favorable
  winds.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
  The four finish their meal and James feeds Dora. Afterwards, they do
  quick work of the dishes. Annie washes them, Jack rinses them off in
  a bowl of clean water, James dries them, and Michelle puts them away.
  Jack goes to the back of the bus to sleep. The others go to the front.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle sits down in the driver&apos;s seat and attempts to start
  the engine. Nothing happens.<br />
  James says: <span class="quote speech">Oh yeah, that&apos;s been an
  issue.</span><br />
  He grabs a wrench and a jumper cable. Michelle lets him out and he heads
  to the back. They hear him opening a panel followed by arcing noises
  and the engine starts cranking. Michelle turns the key and it fires up.
</p>
<p>
  James returns inside and yawns.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The idea of a nap is very enticing right
  about now...</span><br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">Well, you&apos;ve earned
  it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Thinking about it but not yet...</span><br />
  He sits down behind Michelle and leans forward. <span class="comment">
  Mention at some point before this that there is no wall between the
  driver&apos;s seat and the passenger seats behind it. Maybe they removed
  it for some reason, maybe it wasn&apos;t there to begin with,</span>
  The engine roars as she accelerates the bus and they continue their way.
