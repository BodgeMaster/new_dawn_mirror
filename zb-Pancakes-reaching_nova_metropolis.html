<h1>
  Pancakes
</h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Good morning, Annie! Pancakes are ready.</span>
  <br />
  Jack takes his hand off her shoulder. She pushes herself up from her bed
  and looks around in confusion. James is driving the bus on a surprisingly
  very intact highway through a seemingly endless landscape of sand and
  sparse vegetation. The sun is already high up in the sky and
  yesterday&apos;s mountains are in the distance far behind them. Jack goes
  to wake up Michelle, then he tells James who stops the bus and turns off
  the engine.
</p>
<p>
  Annie swings her legs out of bed and sits up. She stretches and yawns,
  gets up, and shuffles over to the table. Jack puts a large plate with
  a pile of pancakes in the center and grabs plates for everyone.
  He also places a few jars on the table:
  Honey, Chocco <span class="comment">TODO: Add an advert for Chocco
  somewhere earlier in the story. It&apos;s the in-universe equivalent
  of Nutella.</span>, and cinnamon with sugar <span class="comment">Is that
  combination as ubiquitous worldwide as it is in Germany? If so, does it
  have a proper name?</span>. James gets up from the driver's seat and Dora
  follows him, wagging her tail. They all sit down around the table,
  including Dora who sits on the floor and <span class="comment">macht
  gro&szlig;e augen</span>.<br />
  <span class="comment">What is the English command for a dog to lay
  down?</span>
</p>
<p>
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">So when are we gonna reach
  the &lt;mining company&gt; pit?</span><br />
  Jack looks at James. James tilts his head slightly and shrugs.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Like five hours ago?</span><br />
  <!-- Jack's shift until midnight, James' shift until 6AM, plan was for
  Michelle's shift to start at the pit, it is now 9AM. -->
  <span class="quote speech">You&apos;re kidding.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Didn&apos;t wanna wake you up.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhh...</span> Michelle is at a loss for words.
  <br />
  James grins.<br />
  She says: <span class="quote speech">Can&apos;t even be mad... But
  doesn&apos;t that mean that we&apos;re way ahead of time?</span><br />
  James shrugs again.<br />
  Jack glances at his watch and says: <span class="quote speech">About
  two and a half hours give or take. With a bit of luck, we&apos;ll be
  even more ahead when we arrive. We&apos;ve had some quite favorable
  winds.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
  The four finish their meal and James feeds Dora. Afterwards, they do
  quick work of the dishes. Annie washes them, Jack rinses them off in
  a bowl of clean water, James dries them, and Michelle puts them away.
  Jack goes to the back of the bus to sleep. The others go to the front.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle sits down in the driver&apos;s seat and attempts to start
  the engine. Nothing happens.<br />
  James says: <span class="quote speech">Oh yeah, that&apos;s been an
  issue.</span><br />
  He grabs a wrench and a jumper cable. Michelle lets him out and he heads
  to the back. They hear him opening a panel followed by arcing noises
  and the engine starts cranking. Michelle turns the key and it fires up.
</p>
<p>
  James returns inside and yawns.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The idea of a nap is very entising
  <span class="comment">spelling?</span> right about now...</span><br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">Well, you&apos;ve earned
  it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Thinking about it but not yet...</span><br />
  He sits down behind Michelle and leans forward. <span class="comment">
  Mention at some point before this that there is no wall between the
  driver&apos;s seat and the passenger seats behind it. Maybe they removed
  it for some reason, maybe it wasn&apos;t there to begin with,</span>
  The engine roars as she accelerates the bus and they continue their way.
