Outline:

- Lena and Emily put on their space suits to go outside
  - (imply that Lena is about to die)
  - Lena double-checks that Emily can get back inside
  - Emily helps Lena with her helmet
  - something to the effet of Lena is leaving for one final time
- they go to the grave of Lena’s SO
- once there, they sit down on the ground
  - Emily helps Lena take her life support unit off her back
  - Lena sits down leaning against a rock, her life support unit next to her
  - "You were ultimately right" conversation
    - Lena has to tell Emily that she should get in touch with Jack using the downlink
- Emily leaves and returns with new oxygen canisters
- Lena dies
- Emily returns inside and goes to the top level of the base
  - following any procedures such as operating the air lock as robot-like as possible
  - she lies down on the floor and looks out the window in the ceiling
  - she remains on the floor for an absurd amount of time
- Jack uses the uplink to dial into the station

Emily and Lena start putting on their space suits. Emily is done relatively quickly while Lena makes slow progress as she struggles to keep her balance. Half-way through, she gives up, sitting down on the bench across from the air lock. Emily helps her all the way into the suit. Lena sits there for a moment, heavily breathing, while Emily waits.  
"Sorry, I can’t... I feel exhausted."

Emily takes their helmets and brings them into the airlock. She returns for a life support unit, pulls it out of the rack in the wall, and sets it down on the floor. Following a mental checklist, she makes sure that the air tank is connected properly and the status display reads what it should. Everything okay... or is it? She double-checks with the check list on the wall. Yes, this unit is ready. She triple-checks everything - first time it actually matters. Reasonably satisfied with her findings, she carries it over to the air lock. Then, she repeats this procedure for the second unit. Finally, she helps Lena up and they get into the airlock.

*time jump? if no, missing section of putting on helmets and life support systems*

Lena leaning on Emily, they walk over to the grave yard.
