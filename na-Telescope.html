<h1>Telescope</h1>
<p>
  Jack grabs the map from the center console.<br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">I know the way.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wanna drive?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sure.</span><br />
  He puts the map back, hands her the keys, and the four get in the truck.
  James joins Michelle in the front and has Dora jump in
  <span class="comment">translate: in seinen Fu&szlig;raum</span>, Annie
  and Jack take the rear seats. A few moments later, Michelle pulls onto
  the street in front of the bunker.<br />
  James asks her: <span class="quote speech">How far is it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">A decent bit. Used to be about an hour on the
  highway. If it&apos;s in even somewhat decent shape, I&apos;d say
  we&apos;re gonna make it there in about that time.</span><br />
  She turns right at an intersection onto the on-ramp, saying:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gonna find out very soon...</span>
</p>
<p>
  The pavement is cracked and has potholes, and the highway is partially
  overgrown but, despite this, its condition is somehow good enough.
  Michelle floors it and the truck rattles and shakes as it accelerates
  on the uneven asphalt. James <span class="comment">hangs on to the handle
  </span>in the door as the remains of the city outskirts fly by.
  Michelle takes notice:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">James, relax, that seat belt is gonna hold
  you.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">How are you not absolutely terrified by the
  speed?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You get used to it... Also, I know very well
  what I can or can&apos;t do with this car &ndash; I used to drive the
  same back then.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">Maybe add a section about Dora acting up?</span>
</p>
<p>
  Within a few minutes, they make it out of Ivydale, leaving its valley
  behind. The mountains make way for an area of plains and shallow hills.
  The large, rusty signs above still indicate the proximity of
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores where they haven&apos;t faded completely. Following
  them, Michelle takes an exit onto another highway that leads north,
  around the western part of Ivydale&apos;s lower side.
</p>
<p>
  After a while, they approach what used to be the outskirts of
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores and Michelle takes an exit, getting them onto
  a rural road. The observatory is located on a hill, now ahead of them
  &ndash; a small group of buildings in the distance.
  As they get closer, the buildings take distinct shapes. Two of them
  stand out: The one in the center holds a large geodesic dome and another
  one off to the side behind it is a smooth round dome with a slot cut out
  of it for a telescope to peek through. Well, it <i>was</i> smooth at one
  point &ndash; now, it has many holes with a tree growing out of the
  largest one. The geodesic dome has ivy vines clinging to it but looks
  otherwise surprisingly intact. The other buildings look like mostly
  unremarkable ruins in various stages of decay.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">James, I&apos;m sorry, but it doesn&apos;t
  look like you&apos;ll be able to look through that telescope &ndash; or
  anyone for that matter...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Aww, what a let-down. Still gonna look for
  pictures there... Didn&apos;t you say you also need a telescope?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">There are two telescopes here: The optical one
  back there and the radio telescope in that ball of triangles in the
  middle there. That&apos;s essentially just a really big antenna.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">An antenna but you call it a telescope?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">It works similarly, just for imaging a much
  lower part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Stars give off a bunch more
  than just visible light.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Can we try that one?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">A lot of things would have to go right for
  that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  She drives through what remains of an open gate, onto a large,
  overgrown paved area inbetween the buildings, going around
  the radio telescope and parking the truck between it and the optical
  one. They get out and look around. Trees and bushes grow all over
  the place, some even out of the buildings&apos; walls. Dora runs up
  to one of the bushes and barks at it. A young fox jumps out and runs
  away.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Dora, c&apos;mere!</span>
</p>
<p>
  They start by exploring the optical telescope. The lower part of the
  building is filled with <span class="comment">some technology stuff,
  preferably not all computers</span> and filing cabinets. Most of their
  contents are rotting sheets of paper holding documents and logs.
  Annie finds a folder with photos that are partially stuck together.
  The ones in the front depicting the outside of the observatory but
  there is at least one depicting a nebula.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">James, look what I found.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oooh thanks!</span><br />
  He takes it and puts it into a bag.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, Jack has found a way upstairs. The staircase has partially
  collapsed so he moves one of the filing cabinets in their place and
  climbs to the next floor.<br />
  <span class="quote speech"></span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Plot hole: why geodesic dome?
  They start exploring in the optical telescope building - not wasting
  too much time there. Then, they go into the radome.
