  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">I know the way.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wanna drive?</span> <span class="comment">make
  it clear that Jack says this</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sure.</span><br />
  The four of them get in the truck and she pulls onto the road in front of
  the bunker.<br />
  James asks: <span class="quote speech">How far is it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">A decent bit. About an hour if the highway is
  in good shape.</span> She turns right at an intersection onto the
  on-ramp <span class="comment">Is that a word? I&apos;m 80% sure...</span>
  of said highway.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re gonna find out very soon...</span>
  she adds.
</p>
<p>
  The highway has potholes and is partially overgrown but its condition is
  somehow good enough to drive fast. Michelle floors it and the city
  outskirts fly by. Within a couple minutes, they make it out of Ivydale,
  leaving its valley behind. The mountains make way for an area of plains.
  Michelle takes an exit onto another highway. The large, rusty signs above
  the road still indicate the proximity of Sentinel Shores where they
  haven&apos;t faded completely.

<p>
  The highway takes them north, around the western part of Ivydale&apos;s
  lower side. After a while, they approach Sentinel Shores and Michelle
  takes an exit onto a rural road. The observatory is located on a hill
  ahead of them. It&apos;s a small group of buildings around a large round
  building with a dome for a roof. Off to the side is a group of four
  towers, three of them still holding small geodesic domes.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle parks the truck on what remains of the large paved area between
  the buildings and they get out. Trees and bushes grow all over the place,
  some even out of the windows of the buildings.

  What now? They start exploring but where to they begin?
