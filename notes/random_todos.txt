Random ToDos:

- Rename all train stations except "Central", "West", etc. in
  Sentinel Shores and Ivydale
  - Fish Market -> Sea Market
- Home computers should be more like C64s
- The moon base is, in fact, a moon colony
  - official name: "Lunar Biosphere"
- Double-check that I changed all references of Annie leaving the city to
  not imply this was planned. I changed my mind about the situation; it was
  something that came from plans going wrong.
- quoted strings:
  - treat literal speech, literal thoughts, and other quoted strings
    differently
  - format literal speech and literal thoughts differently from the rest of
    the paragraph
  -  versions of this as span and paragraph
    - paragraph version needs to deal with the fact that speeches can have
      multiple paragraphs
  - what is CSS property "quotes"?
- Update all the information in all files in the 'notes' directory.
  They have been throuroughly neglected.
