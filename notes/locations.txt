Cities:

- Sentinel Shores (formerly Siren’s Edge, Siren’s Song) 
  - post-apocalyptic ruin city
  - close enough to Ivydale that they share a public transport system
  - located on the coast 
    - has (used to have) a port
  - buildings in various stages of disrepair 
    - including sky scrapers that would fit right in in HZD
  - many things were left behind, definitely worth looting random buildings
  - located on one side of a bay, across from Rogue Tides
  - two groups and some individuals have taken up residence in different
    parts of the city 
    - rival mentality
- Ivydale 
  - post-apocalyptic ruin city
  - close enough to Sentinel Shores that they share a public transport
    system
  - located in a valley
  - buildings in various stages of disrepair 
    - no sky scrapers
  - many things were left behind, definitely worth looting random buildings
- Underground Dome City 
  - still needs a name
  - inside a huge hermetically sealed dome under a mountain
  - basically a normal city otherwise 
    - mostly three to five story buildings
    - some unique buildings and sky scrapers in the center
    - few single-family homes
  - past its prime but most things are intact
  - has a metro for public transport 
    - can be used for entering/leaving the city but that hasn’t been done
      since the apocalypse and it’ s strictly forbidden
  - food is farmed in big silos adjacent to the dome 
    - illuminated by daylight through hermetically sealed light shafts but
      inaccessible to most ppl
  - ppl mostly lead normal lives and have normal jobs
  - waste water is recycled in a closed loop system 
    - maybe slight water scarcity due to slow treatment process
    - no rivers, bodies of water, or anything like that
  - relies on external facilities for power 
    - Nobody is concerned about the possibility of it ever not being there. 
      - "Power comes from the wall, right?"
  - inhabitants never arrived in the numbers that were expected so, while
    there are a lot of ppl there, roughly half of the homes are time
    capsules
- Nova Metropolis 
  - location of moon girl’s landing
  - much bigger than Sentinel Shores and built inland
  - built around an oasis in a desert 
    - not the kind of desert where sand gets piled up into dunes otherwise
      it would have gotten buried
  - buildings in a lot better shape due to being in a desert
- Siren’s Edge (formerly Westport) 
  - Just a location that is mentioned in passing
- Rogue Tides 
  - small town that has (used to have) a datacenter
  - across the bay from Sentinel Shores


Facilities/Institutions:

- Hydro power station 
  - Name?
  - miraculously still intact and working despite never being maintained
    since the apocalypse
  - power source of the underground city
  - in dire need of repairs
- Cryo Facility 53 
  - built by Neotek Dynamics
  - on the outskirts of Ivydale
  - an attempt to get personnel to survive beyond the apocalypse so they
    can help with keeping the moon colony alive
  - Backstory: A good portion of the bunker crew has been woken up decades
    before Jack 
    - they left to do their mission somehow sending supplies to the moon
    - bunker wasn’t resealed properly 
      - hardware has degraded/failed
      - maybe there could have been other bunker personnel who have
        perished because their preservation chambers failed
        (alternatively, they all left except two)
      - Jack gets woken up due to impending hardware failure
      - Michelle stays preserved until she gets woken up by Jack
  - has enough supplies to last a lot of ppl for a long time
- <underground dome city> library 
  - has large computers in the basement
- retro-futuristic data center 
  - located in Rogue Tides
  - used to be some sort of national archive except it was never finished
  - contains computers that will be used by the protagonists to establish
    communication with the moon 
    - they will have to move them to Sentinel Shores
  - may or may not have turrets or ppl defending it
  - buildings are in bad shape so any hardware recovered from there will
    most likely need some fixing up
- Moon habitat 
  - built by Neotek Dynamics
  - theoretically permanently habitable but not made to exist in isolation
  - home to several hundred people in its prime
