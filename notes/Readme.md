Notes to self:

* Rename all train stations except "Central", "West", etc. in Sentinel Shores and Ivydale
* Jack canâ€™t have a minicomputer in the bunker or if there is one, it has to be useless to him in some way
* Home computers should be more like C64s
* The moon base is, in fact, a moon colony
