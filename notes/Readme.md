Notes to self:

* Rename all train stations except "Central", "West", etc. in Sentinel Shores and Ivydale 
  * Fish Market → Sea Market
* Jack can’t have a minicomputer in the bunker or if there is one, it has to be useless to him in some way
* Home computers should be more like C64s
* The moon base is, in fact, a moon colony
* Double-check that I changed all references of Annie leaving the city to not imply this was planned. I changed my mind about the situation; it was something that came from plans going wrong.
