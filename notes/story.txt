* *... missing things (not in order):* 
  * *power plant shenanigans* 
    * *secret organization has to do things like putting up banners in high-profile locations and/or distribute a manifesto*
    * *power has to go out for a while - or completely until someone fixes the power plant (could be that something breaks while they start up the plant again)*
    * *has to result in the dome city opening up*
    * *IDEA: "The power will be going out on <date> for critical maintenance that you have neglected to do for a century. Shame on you for sticking your heads in the sand instead of facing the problems of the outside world."*
  * *the protagonists move to Sentinel Shores* 
    * *Originally I was thinking they might move to a factory hall or hangar or maybe even one of the lower levels of a sky scraper but it might be more realistic that they just move into the observatory as it's where they work on stuff*
  * *Annie has never been on a boat so they fix one up and hop over to Rogue Tides*
  * *encounter the electronics tinkerer*
  * *problematic encounter with one of the groups/tribes/whatever*

  * *Lena dies*
  * *Emily takes off from the moon*
  * *\[done, needs revision\] Emily lab incident*
  * *they have to, at some point, climb on a sky scraper - maybe even multiple times*
* Emily enters the atmosphere 
  * something goes wrong - either fuckup or technical failure or both
  * she realizes that she is descending waay too fast and tries mentally going through the emergency checklist
* Emily lands


Scene Ideas:
============

Annie, in her search for an alternative to whatever the underground city
has as "coffee", obtains some drug from the electronics tinkerer. She
proceeds to get high as the sky and gets herself into a dangerous
situation before the others catch on to what's happening. Jack will end up
more or less forcing her back to the base and sit there watching her so she
doesn't do anything stupid.

Emily is alone, preparing for her descent to Earth. As part of the
preparations, she releases the remaining lab mice into the biosphere
module (they came from there originally).
