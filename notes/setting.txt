At one point, this was my idea for a setting. I don't like all aspects of it
so this is subject to change where it hasn't already. I might update this
to reflect the current setting when I have real information to fill in.

- post apocalypse scenario 
  - relatively slow, gradual downfall of civilization - not a fast
    wipe out event 
    - ppl had time to prepare
  - humanity discovers a new way to generate nuclear power some time in
    the 80s 
    - upsides: 
      - moar powar
      - less waste
      - comparatively straight-forward to get going
    - downsides: 
      - absolutely needs to be maintained well
      - horrible accidents 
        - huge explosions
        - scatter toxic globs of radioactive chemical sludge 
          - areas where this stuff lands turn into wasteland for centuries
            or millennia
        - release some toxic gas that decays slowly over time
    - power plants of this kind are built everywhere
  - as accidents happen, ppl cry for alternatives but nobody does anything
    about it bc it's not economically viable
  - a bunch of wars happen and a few of the power plants blow up 
    - conventional wars, no MAD scenario
  - areas are abandoned causing civil wars in other locations due to
    refugee crisis
  - in the chaos, more power plants blow up making it difficult to survive
    at the surface due to contaminated atmosphere 
    - the rest of civilization has to wind down and disappears
- story takes place roughly 110 years after the apocalypse 
  - story starts on Tue, 2106-06-01
  - just enough time for no living memory of the "old world" to survive
  - slight retro-futurism 
    - for the most part, technology is stuck in the 80s or 90s, but there
      are some key differences 
      - the underground city has only electric cars
      - aforementioned nuclear power plants
      - successful cryogenic preservation
    - computing is different 
      - home computers are rare - they are similar to early to mid 90s
        machines but have big boy 8" floppy drives
      - business computers are mostly minicomputers or larger 
        - they are actually being used for all sorts of tasks like ordering
          supplies or to check inventory etc
      - computing is dominated by a UNIX-like operating system (INUX lol)
