At one point, this was my idea for a setting. I don't like all aspects of it
so this is subject to change where it hasn't already. I might update this
to reflect the current setting when I have real information to fill in.

- post apocalypse scenario
  - relatively slow, gradual downfall of civilization - not a fast
    wipe out event
    - ppl had time to prepare
  - humanity discovers a new, safe alternative to asbestos in the 1970s
    - problem with it: one of the precursor chemicals is way worse than
      asbestos itself but its fibers decay within a couple years
    - an industrial accident in the late 80s causes an ongoing unstoppable
      reaction producing this material
    - attempts to contain it fail and the atmosphere gets contaminated
    - the reaction continues producing the material for at least a decade,
      possibly even into the early 2000s
    - most places are completely unsafe to inhabit by 1995
    - Earth's surface is uninhabitable for decades to come due to the sheer
      amount of fibers that got released into the atmosphere
- story takes place roughly 110 years after the apocalypse
  - story starts on Tue, 2106-06-01
  - just enough time for no living memory of the "old world" to survive
  - slight retro-futurism
    - for the most part, technology is stuck in the 80s or 90s, but there
      are some key differences
      - the underground city has only electric cars
      - successful cryogenic preservation
    - computing is different
      - home computers are rare - they are similar to early to mid 90s
        machines but have big boy 8" floppy drives
      - business computers are mostly minicomputers or larger
        - they are actually being used for all sorts of tasks like ordering
          supplies or to check inventory etc
      - computing is dominated by a UNIX-like operating system (INUX lol)
