  <span class="speech">Why not?</span><br />
  Emily looks back and forth between Lena and Sasha.<br />
  <span class="speech">Tony said he had some success with his mice, why
  shouldn&apos;t we try it?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Tony also died after</span> &ndash; Sasha is
  interrupted by coughing &ndash; <span class="speech">after trying it
  on himself.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Not like anything else is gonna happen to
  us...</span><br />
  Lena shakes her head.<br />
  <span class="speech">I don&apos;t want to spend my remaining days alone.
  Just don&apos;t do it, please.</span><br />
  Emily gets up and paces around the module. <span class="comment"> Is that
  proper grammar?</span> Her eyes fall on the drawers in the adjacent
  maintenance module. An idea forms in her head...<br />
  <span class="speech">Emily, where are you going?</span><br />
  She steps inside and rummages through a bunch of drawers, leaving them
  open as she opens the next one.<br />
  <span class="speech">What are you doing with that hammer?</span><br />
  She storms off into the hallway; Lena jumps up and runs after her.
</p>
<p>
  As she runs through the door to the lab module, she smashes the hammer
  into its control panel. Arcing noises, the hissing of air pressure
  getting released, the broken equipment alarm beeps. The door comes
  falling down behind her, slamming into the floor and latching with a
  loud click. She looks around for a moment as she catches her breath.
</p>
<p>
  The walls are lined with workbenches and cupboards above them. In the
  center is an additional large workbench where Tony&apos;s lab mice are
  still running around in their cage, oblivious to the situation. Emily had
  kept them as pets after he died.
</p>
<p>
  Banging on the door &ndash; Lena is outside. Emily walks over to the
  Erlenmeyer flask that&apos;s sitting next to the sink built into one of
  the workbenches. She lifts it up and looks through the clear, blue
  liquid. Tony had written some science-y words on the flask along with
  &quot;cure 5x concentrated&quot;, and closed it off with a glass stopper.
  Emily removes the stopper and grabs a small beaker from the drying rack
  on the wall above the sink. She pours some of the liquid into the beaker,
  sets the flask aside, and tops it off with water from the tap. Holding
  the beaker in her hands, she hesitates.
</p>
<p>
  Buzzing noises and clicking from the door. The latching mechanism opens.
  Emily&apos;s hesitation is over, she lifts the beaker to her mouth and
  drinks the liquid. It has a pungent smell and burns in her throat but she
  downs it in two gulps. The door moves up a bit. Through the opening, she
  hears Lena struggling on the other side. A foot appears in the door,
  followed by Lena&apos;s hands. Emily begins to feel dizzy, she sets the
  beaker onto the center workbench and holds on to the edge of the work
  surface. Lena slowly lifts the door and pushes it back into the ceiling,
  holding a screwdriver in her mouth. The panel covering the latching
  mechanism has been removed and is leaning against the wall. Emily starts
  to move towards the door but feels too dizzy to walk. She still sees
  Lena jam the screwdriver in the side of the door before her knees give
  out and she falls. A burning sensation spreads throughout her body as
  she lays on the floor. Lena starts to yell at her but she drifts out of
  consciousness before she can process any of the words.
</p>
<p>
  She wakes up briefly while getting carried down the hallway. The pain is
  unbearable. In an attempt to scream, she sighs before everything goes
  black again. The next time she regains consciousness is while throwing
  up in her bed. She gasps for air, then she drifts away again.
