<h1>Landing Troubles</h1>
<!-- perspective: Emily -->
<p>
  The emergency escape vehicle enters the atmosphere with a jolt.
  <span class="comment">Honestly, I have no idea what it is like to
  enter the atmosphere. Needs research.</span> The displays on the control
  panel flicker and start showing random symbols. Error messages start
  scrolling over the screen. <span class="quote speech">Uh oh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Emily stares at the control panel for a moment trying to think. She grabs
  her emergency notes and frantically searches for the relevant section.
  After finally finding the right page, she presses a few buttons on the
  keyboard. The screen clears and shows the word &quot;HALTED&quot;.
  <!-- TODO: replace this with SPARCstation Stop+A -->
  Then, she flips a bunch of switches to unlock the controls. Clicking and
  clanging under the control panel. The throttle levers and position
  controls start floating. Looking at the next page of her notes, she
  realizes that the order has been messed up. Again, she scrambles through
  the pages until she finds the next instructions.
  <span class="quote non-speech">Wait until the external pressure gauge
  reads <span class="comment">xyz</span> and release the heat shield.</span>
  She looks at the analog gauges at the top of the panel - there it is.
  <span class="comment">barely less than xyz value</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The shield detaches with a bang. Emily flips the switch for the fuel
  pumps, grabs the throttle lever, and pushes it all the way forward.
  Nothing happens. She looks back at the notes - did she miss anything? She
  flips the switch off and on again.
