<h1>Landing Troubles</h1>
<p>
  The escape pod <span class="comment">Is there a word that makes this sound
  more like it&apos;s the technical term?</span> enters the atmosphere with
  a jolt. <span class="comment">Honestly, I have no idea what it is like to
  enter the atmosphere. Needs research.</span> The displays on the control
  panel flicker and start showing random symbols. Error messages start
  scrolling over the screen. <span class="quote speech">Uh oh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Emily stares at the control panel for a moment trying to think. She grabs
  her emergency notes and frantically searches for the relevant section.
  After finally finding the right page, she presses a few buttons on the
  keyboard. The screen clears and shows the word &quot;HALTED&quot;.
  <!-- TODO: replace this with SPARCstation Stop+A -->
  Then, she flips a bunch of switches to unlock the controls. Clicking and
  clanging under the control panel. <span class="comment">Throttle lever and
  position controls start floating</span> Looking at the next page of her
  notes, she realizes that the order has been messed up. Again, she
  scrambles through the pages until she finds the next instructions.
  &quot;Wait until the external pressure gauge reads &lt;xyz&gt; and release
  the heat shield.&quot; She looks at the analog gauges at the top of the
  panel - there it ts. &lt;less than xyz value&gt;.
</p>
<p>
  The shield detaches with a bang. Emily flips the switch for the fuel
  pumps, grabs the throttle lever, and pushes it all the way forward.
  Nothing happens. She looks back at the notes - did she miss anything? She
  flips the switch off and on again.
