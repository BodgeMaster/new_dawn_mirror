The escape lander <Lander is probably not the right word. What did they call the landing module of the moon missions?> enters the atmosphere with a jolt.
<Honestly, I have no idea what it is like to reenter the atmosphere. Needs research.>
The displays on the control panel flicker and start showing random symbols. Error messages start scrolling over the monitor until it
blanks.
"Uh oh."
Emily stares at the control panel for a moment trying to think. She grabs her emergency notes and frantically searches for the relevant section.
After finally finding the right page, she presses a few buttons on the keyboard to halt the computer. Then, she flips a bunch of switches to gain manual
control of the lander. Clicking and clanging under the control panel. Looking at the next page of her notes, she realizes that the order has been messed up.
Again, she scrambles through the pages until she finds the next instructions. Wait until the external pressure gauge reads <xyz> and release the heatshield.
She looks at the analog gauges at the top of the panel - there it ts. <less than xyz value>.

The shield detaches with a bang. Emily flips the switch for the fuel pumps, grabs the throttle lever, and pushes it all the way forward. Nothing happens.
She looks back at the notes - did she miss anything? She flips the switch off and on again. "Nononononono..."
