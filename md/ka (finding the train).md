*Context: They are exploring the Ivydale train yard*

"Michelle! Look what I found..."  
She climbs through the gap between the rotting cars on the adjacent track.  
"Where are you?"  
"Up here."  
Jack had climbed onto the rather sketchy-looking roof of one of the trains. Michelle climbs onto the link between cars and Jack helps her to the top.  
"Over there..."  
He points across the deteriorating metro trains towards the outermost track of the overgrown train yard. A small roof - or in places what remains of it - extends over the track from the side of a large building. Under the roof are several tank cars. Some are rusted through or missing parts, but a few look like they might still hold liquids.  
"Oh, wow! Maybe there’s some gas left in there or something..."  
"My thought. Let’s check it out."

They climb back down and make their way over to one of the tank cars. They climb onto the side of the car and Jack attempts to use the ladder that leads to the top. It crumbles under his feet.  
"I guess I found the way down - hey, use me as a ladder."  
He leans against the car and helps her onto the tank.  
Michelle inspects the lid.
"Do we have a wrench or something?"  
Jack looks around.  
"I don’t know. Lemme take a look inside there..."  
He disappears through where used to be a door. After a moment, he reappears, triumphantly holding a large adjustable wrench.  
"It’s a bit rusty but should do the job."  
"I’m afraid to see what you call very rusty."  
"This thing, for example."  
He knocks it against the ladder on the side of the tank causing more pieces to break off. Then, he hands the wrench to her. After a bit of fiddling, she manages to get a good grip on one of the nuts holding the lid in place - it doesn’t budge.  
"Need a hammer or something?"  
"Can you hand me that pipe? It should do."  
Jack picks up a section of metal pipe and passes it to her. Putting it over the wrench for additional leverage, she pushes against it until the bolt snaps with a bang.  
"Well that’s one way for that to come off."

*missing section: Michelle opens the lid and finds some disappointing fact - it’s empty or whatever*  
*then repeat for another one*

The contents of the next tank are more promising.  
"Smells like diesel... We should go find a truck or something to drive around."  
"Okay, uhh, stupid idea but I need to show you something." Jack grins.  
"Oh no, what are you up to again?"  
"Nothing in particular... Wanna follow me for a sec?"  
Michelle jumps down onto the edge of the car, then to the ground and follows him to the entrance.

He walks over the door on the floor, past a counter to the left, into the wide open hall. It is dimly lit by the light that makes it through the dirty windows and small holes in the surprisingly intact roof. *note: Make it more clear that the windows are below the roof. Also, I imagine them to be milky windows for some reason.* A few rows of large industrial shelves on the other side of the hall hold partially rotting crates. On either side of the area with the shelves are spacious areas with machine tools, small cranes, and other machinery. A few plants grow here and there. A single train tack goes through the center of the hall with additional tracks for a gantry crane to either side of it. At the end of the hall to the right, below the rusty crane, sits a train wrapped up in tarps.

"Stupid idea indeed", she says while walking towards it. Then, she corrects herself: "Actually, it might not be that stupid. It should have a generator that we can use."
"That is if we can get it to a location where it would be useful."
"Is there a railroad close to the bunker?"
"Not that I know of, the closest would be somewhere around Ivydale South."
"Okay, not very useful. Let’s go find a truck then."
