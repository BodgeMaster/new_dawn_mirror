- They turn a bus into an improvised offroad-camper
- Last communication with Emily
- Emily takes off from the moon
- They set off into the mountains
  - problematic and sometimes non-existing roads
  - they face an unexpected obstacle and lose a lot of time
  - Jack and James end up driving through the night - unbeknownst to Annie and Michelle
- The highway through the desert is in very good condition (= not completely buried by sand)
  - because of this and them driving through the night, they arrive very early
- exploring Nova Metropolis (basically a time capsule)
  - in the evening, they make their way to the roof of a sky scraper (see zz...)
