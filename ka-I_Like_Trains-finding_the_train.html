<h1>I Like Trains</h1>
<!-- perspective: Michelle -->
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle! Guess what I found...</span><br />
  The two are exploring one of Ivydale&apos;s train yards. Michelle climbs
  through between the rotting cars on an adjacent track, looking for him.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">No idea. Where are you?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Up here.</span><br />
  Jack is standing atop one of the metro trains. She climbs onto the link
  between cars, from there onto the the edge of the broken windshield,
  and he helps her up to the rather sketchy-looking roof.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Over there...</span><br />
  He points across the deteriorating trains, towards the outermost track of
  the overgrown train yard. A small roof &ndash; or in places what remains
  of it &ndash; extends from the side of a large building over several
  tank cars sitting there. Some are rusted through or missing parts, but
  a few look like they might still hold liquids.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, wow! Maybe there&apos;s some gas left in
  there or something...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">My thought. Let&apos;s check it out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They climb back down and make their way over. Jack clmbs onto the end
  of one of the more intact-looking cars and attempts to use the ladder
  to the top. It crumbles under his feet.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Guess I found the way down.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I got this, help me up there.</span><br/>
  He leans against the tank and helps her jump on top.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle inspects the lid. It&apos;s held on with large nuts.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Do we have a wrench or something?</span><br />
  Jack looks around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Idunno. Lemme take a look in
  there...</span><br />
  He disappears through an opening in the wall where a door used to be.
  After a moment, he reappears, triumphantly holding a huge adjustable
  wrench.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s slightly rusty but should do the
  job.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m afraid to see what you call very
  rusty.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">This thing, for example.</span><br />
  He hits it against the ladder, causing a large section to break off and
  crumble. Then, he hands the wrench over. After a bit of fiddling, she
  manages to get a good grip on one of the nuts holding the lid in place
  &ndash; it doesn&apos;t budge.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Can you hand me one of these pipes?</span>
  <br />
  Jack picks up a section of metal pipe and passes it to her. Putting it
  over the wrench for additional leverage, she pushes against it until the
  bolt snaps with a bang.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s certainly one of the ways to
  unbolt this thing...</span> she says before moving on to the next one.
</p>
<p>
  One by one, she removes the other nuts. Some of them snap off, some
  unscrew with considerable force. She lets go of the pipe and attempts
  to lift the lid &ndash; it&apos;s still stuck in place. She whacks
  the wrench against its side until it comes loose...<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a whole loada nothing in
  here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech"><i>Great.</i> I guess there are a bunch more
  we can try.</span> <span class="comment">needs a better reaction, may
  want to state disappointment explicitly</span><br />
  She jumps back down onto the end of the car.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks like we&apos;ll be climbing a bunch of
  tank cars today.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s see about that... Mind giving me
  the wrench for a moment?</span><br />
  He jumps over the gap between cars and uses it to knock against the wall
  of the next tank.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sounds empty.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The third tank seems more promising. It only makes a dull <i>clunk</i>
  when Jack hits it with the wrench. Michelle climbs on top again.
  The nuts on this one come off more easily and it doesn&apos;t take
  long until she lifts the lid.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Jackpot!</span> She sniffs the smell coming
  off the liquid inside. <span class="quote speech">Smells like
  diesel.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nice! Let&apos;s find a truck or something...
  Wait, stupid idea but I need to show you...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh no, what are you up to again?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nothing in particular. Wanna follow me for
  a sec?</span>
</p>
<p>
  She jumps down and follows him back to the former doorway.
  They walk over the door on the floor, past a counter to the left, into
  a wide open hall. It is dimly lit by the light getting through
  dirty windows and small holes in the surprisingly intact roof.
  <span class="comment">note: Make it more clear that the windows are
  below the roof. Also, I imagine them to be milky windows for some reason.
  </span> A few rows of large industrial shelves on the other side of the
  hall hold partially rotting crates. To either side of them are open
  spaces with machine tools, small cranes, and other machinery. A few
  plants grow here and there. A single train track gioes through the center
  of the hall with additional sets of rails for a gantry crane besides it.
  To the right, at the end of the hall, sits a train wrapped up in tarps
  below the rusty gantry crane.

<p class="comment">
  The following dialog nededs to go / be entirely rewritten.
</p>
<p>
  <!-- rewrite idea:
  "So you wanna strap a generator to that thing?"
  "It's the diesel-electric version, they let me test drive it a few
  times."
   -->
  <span class="quote speech">Stupid idea indeed</span>, she says while
  walking towards it. Then, she corrects herself:
  <span class="quote speech">Actually, it might be useful. That&apos;s one
  of the diesel-electric ones, right?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, I thought we drink the diesel and push
  this thing around for fun.</span> He grins.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, so can we use its generator?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe, if we can get it to a location where
  it's useful.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There is no railroad close to the
  bunker?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not that I know of, the closest would be
  somewhere around Ivydale South.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, not very useful. That wasn&apos;t very
  well planned, Mr infrastructure guy.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s go find a truck.</span>
