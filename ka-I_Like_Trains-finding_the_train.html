<h1>I Like Trains</h1>
<p class="comment">
  Context: They are exploring the Ivydale train yard
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle! Look what I found...</span><br />
  She climbs through the gap between the rotting cars on the adjacent
  track.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Where are you?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Up here.</span><br />
  Jack is standing on the rather sketchy-looking roof of one of the
  trains. Michelle climbs onto the link between cars and Jack helps her
  to the top.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Look, over there...</span><br />
  He points across the deteriorating metro trains towards the outermost
  track of the overgrown train yard. A small roof - or in places what
  remains of it - extends over the track from the side of a large building.
  Several tank cars sit under it. Some are rusted through or missing
  parts, but a few look like they might still hold liquids.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, wow! Maybe there&apos;s some gas left in
  there or something...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">My thought. Let&apos;s check it out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They climb back down and make their way over to one of the tank cars.
  Jack clmbs onto the side of the car and attempts to use the ladder
  leading to the top. It crumbles under his feet.
  <span class="quote speech">I guess I found the way down - hey, use me as
  a ladder.</span> He leans against the tank and helps her up on top of it.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle inspects the lid. It&apos;s held on with large nuts.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Do we have a wrench or something?</span><br />
  Jack looks around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t know. Lemme take a look inside
  there...</span><br />
  He disappears through an opening in the wall where used to be a door.
  After a moment, he reappears, triumphantly holding a large adjustable
  wrench.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s a bit rusty but should do the
  job.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m afraid to see what you call very
  rusty.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">This thing, for example.</span><br />
  He knocks it against the side of the tank causing more pieces of the
  ladder to break off. Then, he hands the wrench to her. After a bit of
  fiddling, she manages to get a good grip on one of the nuts holding the
  lid in place - it doesn&apos;t budge.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Need a hammer or something?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Can you hand me that pipe? It should
  do.</span><br />
  Jack picks up a section of metal pipe and passes it to her. Putting it
  over the wrench for additional leverage, she pushes against it until the
  bolt snaps with a bang.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s certainly one of the ways to undo
  a nut.</span><br />
  She moves on to the next one.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section: Michelle opens the lid and finds some disappointing
  fact - it&apos;s empty or whatever<br />
  then repeat for another one
</p>
<p>
  The contents of the next tank are more promising.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Smells like diesel... We should go find a
  truck or something to drive around.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, uhh, stupid idea but I need to show you
  something.</span> Jack grins.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh no, what are you up to again?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nothing in particular... Wanna follow me for a
  sec?</span><br />
  Michelle jumps down onto the edge of the car, then to the ground and
  follows him to the entrance.
</p>
<p>
  He walks over the door on the floor, past a counter to the left, into the
  wide open hall. It is dimly lit by the light that makes it through the
  dirty windows and small holes in the surprisingly intact roof.
  <span class="comment">note: Make it more clear that the windows are
  below the roof. Also, I imagine them to be milky windows for some reason.
  </span> A few rows of large industrial shelves on the other side of the
  hall hold partially rotting crates. On either side of the area with the
  shelves are spacious areas with machine tools, small cranes, and other
  machinery. A few plants grow here and there. A single train track goes
  through the center of the hall with additional tracks for a gantry crane
  to either side of it. At the end of the hall to the right, below the
  rusty crane, sits a train wrapped up in tarps.

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Stupid idea indeed</span>, she says while
  walking towards it. Then, she corrects herself:
  <span class="quote speech">Actually, it might be useful. That&apos;s one
  of the diesel-electric ones, right?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, I thought we drink the diesel and push
  this thing around for fun.</span> He grins.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, so can we use its generator?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe, if we can get it to a location where
  it's useful.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There is no railroad close to the
  bunker?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not that I know of, the closest would be
  somewhere around Ivydale South.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, not very useful. That wasn&apos;t very
  well planned, Mr infrastructure guy.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s go find a truck.</span>
