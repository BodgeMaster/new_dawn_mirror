<h1>&lt;Lena first contact&gt;</h1>

<p>
  Michelle and James drag the comms unit off the truck bed and carry it
  inside. Jack grabs a large box filled with all sorts of cables and spare
  parts and follows them. Annie follows not long after, carrying a stack of
  thick binders of documentation. They walk up the stairs and set their
  things down somewhere off to the side. Then, they go for round
  two, fetching a generator, two fuel canisters, a toolbox,
  <span class="comment">something else</span> from the truck.
  <!--
    Things they will need later:
    - oscilloscope
    - telephone
    - something to interface with the comms unit
    - radio + antenna
    - bench psu
    - oil for gearboxes
  -->
</p>
<p>
  <span class="comment">They have tried cranking the dish around by hand
  at some point before this. The tilt mechanism is completely seized up,
  the pan mechanism spins freely and doesn&apos;t work.</span><br />
  Jack begins to disassemble the gearbox in the floor that used to pan
  the dish around. Michelle looks up at the tilt mechanism and gets
  an idea.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">James, help me up there.</span><br />
  With his help, she jumps up to the lower side of the dish and clings to
  a structural beam on its underside. From there, she climbs up to a thick
  cable hanging near the center.<br />
  She calls down to James: <span class="quote speech">Can you pass me
  a screwdriver? Need a large flathead.</span><br />
  He grabs one from the toolbox.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Catch!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Whoop... Thanks.</span><br />
  Sitting on the cable, she begins to remove the gearbox cover in front
  of her.
</p>
<p>
  After a while, she gets it loose and it falls towards her.
  She struggles to keep her balance for a moment as the cover lands wedged
  between her legs and the central <span class="comment">post? beam?</span>
  holding the dish. With some effort, she manages to wrangle it to th other
  side of the cable.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">James, Annie, can you catch this? Careful,
  it&apos;s heavy.</span><br />
  The two stand across from each other and extend their arms. Michelle
  lets go and they catch it. She turns her attention back to the gearbox
  in front of her. It is completely dried out and the large gears appear
  to be stuck together with some dark brown gunk.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think this one just needs to be cleaned and
  lubricated.</span><br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Wish I could say the same...</span>
  <br />
  She looks down at the gearbox he is taking apart. One of the gears
  had been partially stripped of its teeth and another one is fractured
  right through the middle. Jack has already removed some of the gears
  and is using a screwdriver as a pry bar for the next one.<br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">You gonna break that
  thing.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m sure as fuck not putting my fingers
  in there.</span><br />
  He walks over to the toolbox and grabs a much bigger one.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle begins to scrape off some of the brown gunk but can't get the
  gears to move. Meanwhile, Jack finishes taking his gearbox apart and
  organizes the parts on the floor, laying them out in rows. She climbs
  down and they discuss what to do next.<br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">This one could probably be welded
  back together.</span><br />
  He picks up the pieces of the split gear.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No clue what to do about that one
  though.</span><br />
  He points to the one that had some of its teeth stripped.<br />
  James asks: <span class="quote speech">Without the gears in there,
  can&apos;t we just push the dish around?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Dunno, we can try &ndash; though it might
  just be too heavy.</span><br />
  <!-- They mount a log/beam to the outside of the lower part -->
  <!-- no workie -->

  <span class="comment">missing section</span>
</p>
<p>
  The oscilloscope shows a thick wobbly line. Michelle slightly adjusts
  the knob for the trigger frequency until the image turns into a
  continuous sine wave, slowly rolling to the left.<br />
  She says: <span class="quote speech">I think that&apos;s their carrier.
  It worked.</span><br />
  Jack flips a switch on the project box.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ringing.</span><br />
  Michelle picks up the receiver and listens.<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Beeeeep.&emsp;&emsp;Beeeeep.&emsp;&emsp;
  Beeeeep.&emsp;&emsp;Beeeeep.</span>
  <br />
  It takes a while for someone to pick up.<br />
  A female voice greets her: <span class="quote speech">Hello?</span><br />
  Michelle gestures for Jack to flip the switch back and speaks into the
  phone:
  <span class="quote speech">This is ground support facility 53. Do you
  hear me?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes, I can hear you. So good to hear a human
  voice.</span><br />
  Jack hears it and says quietly: <span class="quote speech">And I thought
  we were the ones facing unexpected difficuties...</span><br />
  Michelle notices the carrier strength gradually dropping and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Listen, we don&apos;t have much time.
  We&apos;re on makeshift equipment. Please turn on the radio in front of
  you and tune to
  <span class="comment">some frequency or channel</span>.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Understood. Please stay on the line.</span>
  <br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">I give it about ...</span>
  <br />
  She looks at the oscilloscope.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... three minutes until the connection
  drops out.</span><br />
  The voice on the other end frantically mumbles to herself:
  <span class="quote speech">How&apos;s this thing work...</span><br />
  Michelle turns the receiver away from her mouth.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Jack, I need the manual. Radio panel.</span>
  <br />
  He opens it at one of the bookmarks and hands it over. The page depicts
  the control panel on the other end.<br />
  Speaking into the phone again, Michelle says:
  <span class="quote speech">There should be a button labeled
  EGCR-1. Push that in and flip the switch next to it up to
  <span class="quote non-speech">AM</span>. Turn TXP to max, then search
  for the frequency.</span><br />
  <!-- EGCR = Emergency Ground Comms Radio -->
  The voice comes through slightly choppy:
  <span class="quote speech">Th-ank-s.</span><br />
  The wave on the oscilloscope is now almost flat.<br />
  The phone plays an automated error message:
  <span class="quote speech">Dish unresponsive. Attempting network
  handoff.</span><br />
  Relays click inside the comms unit and some status indicators light up
  red. The green lights next to the network ports flicker for a moment,
  then turn off again.<br />
  Another error message: <span class="quote speech">Handoff failed.
  Consult operational manu...</span><br />
  Michelle puts the receiver down.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="comment">The following dialog would benefit greatly from
  proper radio protocol. Unfortunately, that is sonething I have yet to
  learn. Feel free to send me a fixed version of it.</span><br />
  James aims the antenna at the moon. <span class="comment">It&apos;s
  resting on some kind of stand.</span> Jack takes the microphone off a
  desktop radio and pushes the talk button a few times. An indicator light
  on the radio blinks as he does.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks good...</span>
  He speaks into the mic: <span class="quote speech">This is ground
  facility 53. Do you copy?</span><br />
  He waits for a response.<br />
  Nothing.<br />
  He repeats himself: <span class="quote speech">This is ground
  facility 53. Do you copy?</span><br />
  A few repeats later, the female voice answers:
  <span class="quote speech">There we go... Loud and clear.</span><br />
  <!--
  Lena: Who are you?
  Jack: Name's Jack. You were just on the phone with my colleague Michelle.
        We're Neotek Dynamics staff.
  Lena: That sounds about as believable as the fact you're talking to me
        in the first place. I thought I'd never hear another human voice.
        Name's Lena.
  Jack: You are alone? What happened?
  Lena: Everyone's dead. Succumbed to a disease that I myself wil die to
        soon. The only other person up here is my sister who managed
        to get herself into a coma.
  Jack: <response?>
  <missing>

  Jack: <inquires about state of Emily>
  Lena: She drank what was a failed attempt at creating a cure.
  Jack: Is there any chance she's gonna wake up again?
  Lena: I don't know. Before her, only Tony took it and he died from it.

  <span class="comment">Missing: they introduce themselves, Lena says
  something along the lines of &quot;everyone is dead&quot;</span>
