  The oscilloscope shows a thick wobbly line. Michelle slightly adjusts
  the knob for the trigger frequency and the image turns into a continuous
  sine wave, slowly rolling to the left.<br />
  She says: <span class="quote speech">I think that&apos;s their carrier.
  It worked.</span><br />
  Jack flips a switch on the project box.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ringing.</span><br />
  Michelle picks up the receiver and listens.<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Beeeeep. Beeeeep. Beeeeep. Beeeeep.</span>
  <br />
  A female voice greets her: <span class="quote speech">Hello?</span><br />
  She gestures for Jack to flip the switch back and says:
  <span class="quote speech">This is ground support facility 53. Do you
  hear me?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes, I can hear you. So good to hear
  someone&apos;s voice.</span><br />
  Jack who had heard it says quietly: <span class="quote speech">And I
  thought we were the ones facing unexpected difficuties...</span><br />
  Michelle notices the carrier strength gradually dropping and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Listen, we don&apos;t have much time.
  We&apos;re on makeshift equipment. Please turn on the radio in front of
  you and tune to <span class="comment">some frequency or
  channel</span>.</span><br />
  The person on the other end says: <span class="quote speech">Understood.
  Please stay on the line.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">As long as possible. If not, we&apos;ll be
  back in 24 hours.</span><br />
  Michelle hears her quietly mumbling to herself:
  <span class="quote speech">How&apos;s this thing work...</span><br />
  She turns the receiver away from her mouth and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Jack, I need the manual.</span><br />
  He opens it at one of the bookmarks and hands it over. The page depicts
  what the control panel on the other end should look like.<br />
  Speaking into the phone again, Michelle says:
  <span class="quote speech">There should be a button labeled
  EGCR-1. Push that in and flip the switch next to it up to
  <span class="quote non-speech">AM</span>. Turn TXP to max, then search
  for the frequency.</span><br />
  <!-- EGCR = Emergency Ground Comms Radio -->
  The voice comes through slightly choppy:
  <span class="quote speech">Th-ank-s.</span><br />
  The wave on the oscilloscope is now almost flat.<br />
  The phone plays an automated error message:
  <span class="quote speech">Dish unresponsive. Attempting network
  handoff.</span><br />
  Relays click inside the comms unit and some status indicators light up
  red. The green lights next to the network ports flicker for a moment,
  then turn off again.<br />
  Another error message: <span class="quote speech">Handoff failed.
  Consult operational manu...</span><br />
  Michelle puts the receiver down.

  <span class="comment">The following dialog would benefit greatly from
  proper radio protocol. Unfortunately, that is sonething I have yet to
  learn. Feel free to send me a fixed version of it.</span><br />
  James aims the antenna at the moon. <span class="comment">It&apos;s
  resting on some kind of stand.</span> Jack takes the microphone off a
  desktop radio and pushes the talk button a few times. An indicator light
  on the radio blinks as he does.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks good...</span>
  He speaks into the mic: <span class="quote speech">This is ground
  facility 53. Do you copy?</span><br />
  He waits for a response.<br />
  Nothing.<br />
  He repeats himself: <span class="quote speech">This is ground
  facility 53. Do you copy?</span><br />
  A few repeats later, the female voice answers:
  <span class="quote speech">There we go... Loud and clear.</span><br />

  something along the lines of &quot;everyone is dead&quot;</span>
