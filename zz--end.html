  The group sits around the pot with leftovers on the gas stove, enjoying
  the view of the skyline from above. To increase their odds of seeing
  where Emily would land, they had decided to wait on top of one of the
  tallest sky scrapers the city had to offer. The intense light of the
  setting sun paints Nova Metropolis in vibrant hues of yellow and orange
  while the moon is already coming over the horizon. They are engaged in
  a conversation about the mind-boggling vastness of space and all it
  contains.

<p>
  The alarm on Jack&apos;s watch interrupts them. He presses one of the
  buttons and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s time. Emily will be entering the
  atmosphere right about now.</span><br />
  They get up. James pulls a pair of binoculars out of his bag. Jack does
  the same. Annie looks at both of them - her face clearly showing her
  disappointment.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t worry, I got ya.</span> says Jack
  as he pulls a second pair out of his bag and hands it to her with a grin.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, thank you!</span> She takes it and they
  start walking towards the edge.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle and James are already leaning against the railing and looking
  towards the sky. Annie and Jack join them. Jack takes a compass out of
  his pocket and briefly looks at it. Then, he points in a direction in the
  sky and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The shuttle should appear somewhere around
  there.</span><br />
  James hands his binoculars to Michelle for a moment.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see it! There!</span> she exclaims before
  handing them back to him.<br />
  It looks like a tiny, red glowing dot in the sky, slowly growing in size.
  For a few minutes, not much seems to happen. The dot gets bigger and
  bigger, turning into a black triangle as the glow fades and finally
  disappears. The shuttle sheds its heat shield as it slowly comes closer.
</p>
<p>
  Around the 15 minute mark, Jack notices that it has moved almost above
  them.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s a bit too close for comfort
  &ndash; and way too fast.</span><br />
  Looking at Annie, who seems visibly scared, he adds:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s not gonna hit us, the odds of that
  are pretty slim, but something&apos;s not right.</span><br />
  As if on cue, the rear end of the shuttle breaks apart, turning into a
  cloud of fragments. The rest plummets into the city moments later, taking
  multiple buildings down with it. The ground shakes slightly. Nobody says
  anything for a while as they watch the buildings around the impact
  crumble and the remaining parts of the shuttle rain out of the sky in a
  mix of shock and awe.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle interrupts the silence: <span class="quote speech">Guys, over
  there!</span> She points into the sky behind them.
  <span class="quote speech">A parachute...</span><br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">This girl has more luck than
  sense.</span><br />
  They watch as it disappears between the buildings.
</p>
<p>
  Annie walks over to their bags and, on a hunch, unpacks the radio
  Jack had insisted on bringing.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe, she can hear us from here...</span>
  <br />
  She hooks up the battery, flips the power switch, and nudges the frequency
  dial until the needle is in the position Jack had marked.<br />
  <span class="comment">Note to self: The battery is a car battery. Make
  that clear at some point before this chapter. Maybe include the part where
  Jack insists on bringing it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Emily, can you hear us? Are you okay?</span>
  <br />
  They hear a slightly distorted but audibly relieved response through the
  noise:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes... Yes. I&apos;m alive... I made it.</span>
  <br />
</p>
<p class="comment">
  This is the very end of the story. I originally didn&apos;t plan for
  anything to happen after this though I have managed to somehow already
  write about an event after this in <a href="./%3F%3F.txt">??.txt</a>.
