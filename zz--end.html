  The group sits around the pot with leftovers on the gas stove, enjoying
  the view of the skyline from above. They had decided to wait on top of
  one of the tallest sky scrapers the city had to offer to increase their
  odds of seeing where Emily would land. The intense light of the sunset
  paints Nova Metropolis in various hues of vibrant orange and the moon
  is already visible in the sky. They are engaged in a conversation about
  the mind-boggling vastness of space and all it contains.

<p>
  The alarm on Jack&apos;s watch interrupts them. He presses one of the
  buttons and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s time. Emily will be entering the
  atmosphere right about now.</span><br />
  They get up. James pulls a pair of binoculars out of his bag. Jack does
  the same. Annie looks at both of them - her face clearly showing her
  disappointment.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t worry, I gotchu.</span> says Jack
  as he pulls a second pair out of his bag before they start walking
  towards the edge.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle and James are already leaning against the railing and looking
  towards the sky. Jack and Annie join them. Jack takes a compass out of
  his pocket and briefly looks at it. Then, he points in a direction in the
  sky and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The pod should appear somewhere around
  there.</span><br />
  James hands his binoculars to Michelle for a moment.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see it! There!</span> she exclaims before
  handing them back to him.
</p>
<p>
  The capsule looks like a tiny, red glowing dot in the sky, slowly
  growing in size. For a few minutes, nothing seems to happen. The dot gets
  bigger and bigger turning into a black circle as the glow dims and
  finally disappears. The pod sheds its heat shield as it slowly comes
  closer.
</p>
<p>
  Around the 15 minute mark, Jack notices that it has moved almost above
  them.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s a bit too close for comfort - and
  way too fast.</span> he says.<br />
  Parts appear to be breaking off from the pod. They watch the last couple
  minutes of the fall realizing that something has seriously gone wrong.
  It plummets into the city, shaking the ground slightly, and taking
  multiple buildings down with it. Nobody says anything for a while as they
  watch the buildings around the impact crumble and the remaining parts
  rain out of the sky in a mix of awe and shock.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Guys, over there!</span> Michelle points into
  the sky behind them. <span class="quote speech">A parachute...</span>
  <br />
  <span class="comment">reaction needed</span><br />
  They watch as it disappears between the buildings.
</p>
<p>
  Annie walks over to Jack&apos;s bag and, on a hunch, unpacks the radio
  he had insisted on bringing.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe, she can hear us from here...</span>
  <br />
  She swiches it on and turns the frequency dial until the needle is in
  the position that Jack had marked.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Emily, can you hear us? Are you okay?</span>
  <span class="comment">Might benefit from proper radio protocol</span>
  <br />
  They hear a slightly distorted but clearly happy response through the
  noise:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes... Yes. I&apos;m alive... I made it.</span>
  <br />
</p>
<p class="comment">
  This is the very end of the story. I originally didn&apos;t plan for
  anything to happen after this though I have managed to somehow already
  write about an event after this in <a href="./%3F%3F.txt">??.txt</a>.
