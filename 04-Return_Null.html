  This has been moved here from chapter 1 &quot;Wake Up&quot;. It should
  be integrated into this chapter instead.

  He walks over to the the teleprinter and opens the lid to find that
  something has eaten most of the paper. He removes the remains and opens
  one of the cabinets under the desks. By some miracle, whatever ate the
  paper didn&apos;t find the rest. He tears off a piece of the stack and
  puts it into the printer, feeding the end into the tractor mechanism.
  Then, he sits down at the terminal and logs on.
  <span class="comment">This should be rephrased to indicate that there
  is some purpose to him opening the lid in the first place, like him
  wanting to change the ribbon bc it's no doubt deteriorated or something
  like that.</span>

  The printer comes to life and starts printing. Jack gets up and walks
  over to it. The printer prints. And it prints some more. The paper
  reaches the floor. Jack picks up the end and holds it, folding the pages
  along the perforated lines as they reach his hands. Finally, the printer
  stops to print. Jack turns the wheel on the side of the printer, manually
  advancing the feed mechanism, until he reaches the end of the page. Then,
  he tears it off and takes the small stack of paper back to the terminal
  desk. Trying his luck with the lamp again, he flips the switch multiple
  times until it stays on.

    The outpost diagnostics suite reports no critical problems at any of
    our outposts. The Lunar Biosphere has, so far, not needed assistance
    from any of the outposts.
    Good work, everyone!

    The Future Is Bright.
