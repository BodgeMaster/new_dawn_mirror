            what happened: They came up with an alternative to asbestos.
            Turns out that a precursor to the new material is even more
            dangerous. A massive industrial accident happens.
            At least, the material breaks down over time.

  Pulling the secondary drive out of the rack takes an unusual amount of
  force. The crunchy bearings scratch on the rails as they get dragged
  forward. After struggling for a bit, Jack finally reaches the point
  where the top cover and the empty compartment for a removable platter
  are fully exposed. He undoes the thumb screws holding them in place,
  then he slides the assembly forward and takes it out, revealing the
  circuit boards, motor, and spindle with fixed platters beneath. A fine
  silver line along the edge in the otherwise brown coating of the top-most
  platter shows where its upper
  head had crashed &ndash; a deep scratch but, with a bit of luck, this
  might still be recoverable. He undoes two more
  thumb screws on the inside and the face plate of the drive comes off.
  Using a small flashlight that he had found in one of the desk cabinets,
  he inspects the three platters: The one on top turns out to be the
  outlier, its underside and both of the other platters have thick
  silver-y white stripes lining their edges.

  This has been moved here from chapter 1 &quot;Wake Up&quot;. It should
  be integrated into this chapter instead.

  He walks over to the the teleprinter and opens the lid to find that
  something has eaten most of the paper. He removes the remains and opens
  one of the cabinets under the desks. By some miracle, whatever ate the
  paper didn&apos;t find the rest. He tears off a piece of the stack and
  puts it into the printer, feeding the end into the tractor mechanism.
  Then, he sits down at the terminal and logs on.
  <span class="comment">This should be rephrased to indicate that there
  is some purpose to him opening the lid in the first place, like him
  wanting to change the ribbon bc it's no doubt deteriorated or something
  like that.</span>

  The printer comes to life and starts printing. Jack gets up and walks
  over to it. The printer prints. And it prints some more. The paper
  reaches the floor. Jack picks up the end and holds it, folding the pages
  along the perforated lines as they reach his hands. Finally, the printer
  stops to print. Jack turns the wheel on the side of the printer, manually
  advancing the feed mechanism, until he reaches the end of the page. Then,
  he tears it off and takes the small stack of paper back to the terminal
  desk. Trying his luck with the lamp again, he flips the switch multiple
  times until it stays on.

    The outpost diagnostics suite reports no critical problems at any of
    our outposts. The Lunar Biosphere has, so far, not needed assistance
    from any of the outposts.
    Good work, everyone!

    The Future Is Bright.
