<h1> Return Null </h1>
<!-- perspective: Jack -->
<p>
  Jack stands bowed down in front of the half-height rack, pulling on
  the handles of the secondary hard drive. It takes an unusual amount
  of force to pull out. The crunchy bearings scratch on the rails as
  they get dragged forward. He struggles for a while but, eventually,
  he gets the drive far enough out to fully expose the top cover with
  its compartment for a removable platter.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Anything in here? ... nope.</span><br />
  He undoes the thumb screws holding the assembly in place and lifts it
  out, revealing the the spindle with fixed platters, circuit boards, and
  the motor beneath.
</p>
<p>
  He takes a close look at the upper-most platter. The brown surface
  coating is perfectly smooth &ndash; apart from an almost invisibly fine
  groove along its edge. Most likely the result of a crashed head but it
  looks like it might still be salvageable. He undoes two more thumb screws
  on the inside and the drive&apos;s front cover comes off. To get a better
  look, he takes the lamp off the desk and places it on the floor,
  pointing it at the drive. The light reveals an ugly surprise: The other
  three platters on the spindle get progressively worse. The second one
  has a deep silver groove, the one below has two grooves, and the last
  platter has a thick, silver-y white stripe lining its edge.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, there goes that pipe dream.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack puts the drive back together and pushes it back into the rack.
  Hopefully, Annie can get him the manual for the door, otherwise
  he&apos;ll have to somehow dig his way out of the bunker.
  <span class="quote non-speech">But enough of that for now</span>,
  Jack thinks and puts the thought aside for a while. Now, he needs a way
  to entertain himself until the evening.

  This has been moved here from chapter 1 &quot;Wake Up&quot;. It should
  be integrated into this chapter instead.

  He walks over to the the teleprinter and opens the lid to find that
  something has eaten most of the paper. He removes the remains and opens
  one of the cabinets under the desks. By some miracle, whatever ate the
  paper didn&apos;t find the rest. He tears off a piece of the stack and
  puts it into the printer, feeding the end into the tractor mechanism.
  Then, he sits down at the terminal and logs on.
  <span class="comment">This should be rephrased to indicate that there
  is some purpose to him opening the lid in the first place, like him
  wanting to change the ribbon bc it's no doubt deteriorated or something
  like that.</span>

  The printer comes to life and starts printing. Jack gets up and walks
  over to it. The printer prints. And it prints some more. The paper
  reaches the floor. Jack picks up the end and holds it, folding the pages
  along the perforated lines as they reach his hands. Finally, the printer
  stops to print. Jack turns the wheel on the side of the printer, manually
  advancing the feed mechanism, until he reaches the end of the page. Then,
  he tears it off and takes the small stack of paper back to the terminal
  desk. Trying his luck with the lamp again, he flips the switch multiple
  times until it stays on.

    The outpost diagnostics suite reports no critical problems at any of
    our outposts. The Lunar Biosphere has, so far, not needed assistance
    from any of the outposts.
    Good work, everyone!

    The Future Is Bright.

  missing: Jack reads the logbook, then he dials into the AgriWorks system

  They talk about a few topics:

      Annie&apos;s attempt to get the manual and what followed

      Jack&apos;s background, past life, why he is there

          what happened: They came up with an alternative to asbestos.
          Turns out that a precursor to the new material is even more
          dangerous. A massive industrial accident happens.
          At least, the material breaks down over time.
