<h1> Library At Night</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->
<p>
  11:30 PM &ndash; Isabelle and Annie find themselves at the side entrance
  to the library. They try a couple keys before finding the right one and
  the door swings open with a quiet squeaking noise. The air inside is warm
  and dry. They close the door behind themselves and turn on their
  flashlights.
</p>
<p>
  Following the description Lucas had given, the two find their way down to
  the basement and into a small room. They close the door behind themselves
  and look around. To the left is a desk holding a terminal and a bunch of
  small devices. Across from the door is a row of five racks almost as tall
  as the room itself, filled with computer equipment. A thick trunk of
  cables comes out of a hole in the ceiling and leads to the center rack
  where it splits up and the cables connect to a few panels in the top.
  To the right is a shelf holding various boxes, stacks of flat, round
  cases, and other random things.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I guess this is it. Let&apos;s take a look at
  Karl&apos;s notes</span>, Isabelle says in a hushed voice.<br />
  Annie pulls it out of her bag.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It says to find a terminal connected to the
  computer first. I guess this one will do... By the way, Lucas said
  something about taking a new <span class="quote non-speech"><i>floppy
  disk</i></span> from the shelf, he described it as an eight inch square
  thing. Can you search for that?</span><br />
  Annie goes over to the terminal; Isabelle turns to the boxes. Annie puts
  the keys on the desk and inspects the terminal for cables.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a box with cookies back
  here.</span><br />
  She pulls it out from behind the terminal. <br />
  Isabelle says: <span class="quote speech">I want one.</span><br />
  They giggle. Both end up taking a cookie before stashing the box behind
  the terminal again.
</p>
<p>
  Annie reaches around the side and flips the power switch. The terminal
  makes a <span class="quote non-speech">bonk</span> sound and a crackling
  noise. She feels the hairs on her arm stand up as she inadvertently
  moves it in front of the screen.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Whoa!</span><br />
  The screen begins to light up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... I guess this is supposed to happen.</span>
  <br />
  Annie looks back at the notes.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Computer main power switch to RST...</span>,
  she mumbles to herself.<br />
  She looks at the racks. They are mostly filled with what looks like
  large drawers with buttons on them. The one in the center is different.
  It has a bunch of panels with all sorts of cables plugged into them, most
  of which are part of the trunk from the ceiling. Below that are a couple
  panels with buttons and lights, and a few other devices.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I found you a floppy disk.</span> Isabelle
  interrupts her.<br />
  She pulls a large, square, floppy thing, half-wrapped in a paper sleeve,
  out of one of the boxes. She removes the sleeve. Turns out, it&apos;s
  another sleeve made of thin plastic with openings that were previously
  covered by the paper. The openings reveal something black and shiny.
  <br />
  Annie notices: <span class="quote speech">Someone has written om the
  sleeve, I guess this one has been used.</span><br />
  Isabelle puts it back and grabs an identical box that&apos;s still
  shrink-wrapped. She opens it and takes a disk out.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There we go.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Lucas said to put it in the computer and push
  a lever down.</span><br />
  They look back and forth between the floppy disk and the computer until
  Isabelle points to a device in the center rack with a large, flat slot.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Could fit in there.</span><br />
  She walks up to it and pushes the disk into it. It fits perfectly. Then,
  she pushes on the mechanism in the center of the slot. It latches in
  place.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s next?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The notes say to flip the
  <span class="quote non-speech">main power switch</span> to
  <span class="quote non-speech">RST</span></span> &ndash;
  Annie repeats while inspecting one of the panels with buttons &ndash;
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe this one?</span>
  She points at a key switch with multiple positions.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Only one way to find out.</span><br />
  Isabelle grabs the keys and tries them one by one until one of them fits
  and turns.
</p>
<p>
  Fans come on; they hear the loud noise of air rushing through the
  computer. Some of the lights and buttons light up. Annie looks at the
  notes again: <br />
  <span class="quote speech"><span class="quote non-speech">Spin up boot
  drive</span>... Lucas has also written here:
  <span class="quote non-speech">HDD number two</span></span><br />
  The two look back at the racks.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">These drawer thingies here have numbers on
  them, maybe that&apos;s what they mean?</span><br />
  Isabelle presses the power button on number two. It lights up, some more
  fans come on, and the button next to it starts blinking. She presses it.
  The device makes a loud <span class="quote non-speech">clonk</span>
  noise followed by a motor accelerating inside. Clicking and more
  mechanical noises. The button stops blinking and stays lit up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The last step in the notes says
  <span class="quote non-speech">hold LOAD, main power switch to RUN</span>
  and to enter something into the terminal. And then there&apos;s a list
  of hints and commands that might help us, and
  <span class="quote non-speech">Good luck!</span>...</span><br />
  Isabelle pushes the buttons and Annie walks over to the terminal.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section, probably a &lt;pre class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;
  where Annie, following the steps, enters a few hex codes followed by
  &quot;hd2,vminux&quot;
</p>
<p>
  After a lot of typing into the terminal and figuring things out the hard
  way &ndash; and maybe a couple more cookies disappearing &ndash; they
  manage to find the manual on one of the hard drives and somehow get it
  onto the floppy disk. They follow the instructions to turn the computer
  off and Annie takes the disk out of the computer.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Shhh.</span><br />
  Isabelle gestures for Annie to be quiet. She whispers:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Do you hear that?</span><br />
  Footsteps. Annie nods. Someone is in the building &ndash; and probably
  heard them. Quickly, she puts the disk into her bag.
</p>
<p>
  Opening and closing the door as quietly as possible, they sneak out of
  the room and back towards the stairs. The footsteps are coming closer.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Shit</span>, Isabelle whispers.<br />
  They turn around and sneak to the other end of the hallway. It opens up
  into a room filled with crates that has a small window near the ceiling.
  The footsteps are making their way down the stairs. Annie reaches for
  the window and opens it as quietly as possible while Isabelle
  pushes one of the crates under it - not quite as quietly. The person on
  the stairs starts running. Isabelle jumps onto the crate and quickly
  climbs through the window. Annie, trying to follow her example,
  struggles for a moment to get onto the crate. After she finally manages
  to get up, Isabelle pulls her through the window - not a moment too soon.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Stop! Stay where you are!</span>, a man yells
  at them from inside.<br />
  They start running.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m gonna catch you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Isabelle runs ahead, leading Annie into a dark alley. She climbs onto a
  ledge on the side of a building, helping Annie up after herself. They
  continue running on the ledge until reaching a wall at the end of the
  alley. Isabelle jumps, grabs hold of the railing at the top, pulls
  herself up, and climbs over it.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wait here.</span><br />
  She disappears. Annie looks around nervously. What if she was caught now?
  <br />
  A moment later, Isabelle returns with a ladder. Annie climbs up and
  pulls it up after herself. Isabelle takes it and stashes it on the other
  side of the embankment. They find themselves on the metro tracks.
  Annie looks around nervously.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">We need to get off of here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s fine, we&apos;ll hear any train
  long before we see it.</span> Isabelle points towards a close-by
  station and says <span class="quote speech">Central&nbsp;Square</span>.
  <br />
  They run towards it along the tracks. Just as they make their way onto
  the platform, the rails start ringing.<br />
  Isabelle says with a smirk on her face:
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t think he expects us to have a
  getaway vehicle...</span>
