<h1> Library At Night</h1>
<p>
  11:30 PM - Isabelle and Annie find themselves at the side entrance to
  the library. They try a couple keys before finding the right one. The
  door swings open with a quiet squeaking noise. The air inside is warm
  and dry. The door closes and latches behind them. They turn on their
  flashlights.
</p>
<p>
  Following the description Lucas had given, they find their way into a
  small room in the basement. They close the door behind themselves and
  look around. To the left is a desk with a terminal and a bunch of small
  devices connected together using many cables. The wall in front of them
  is lined with racks that are almost as tall as the room itself and filled
  with computer equipment. To the right is a shelf with boxes.

  Again, request for formatting suggestions below...
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I guess this is it. Let&apos;s take a look at
  the instructions Karl gave you.</span> Isabelle says in a hushed voice.
  <br />
  Annie pulls the note out of her bag.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">First step is turning on the terminal...
  Hey, Lucas said something about using a new floppy disk, can you search
  for that?</span><br />
  Annie walks over to the terminal; Isabelle turns to the boxes on the
  shelf. Annie puts the keys on the desk and inspects the terminal for a
  power switch.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a box with cookies back
  here.</span><br />
  She pulls it out from behind the terminal. They giggle. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I want one</span>, says Isabelle. <br />
  Both end up taking a cookie before stashing the box behind the terminal
  again.
</p>
<p>
  Annie flips the power switch. The terminal makes a bonk sound and a
  crackling noise. She feels the hairs on her arm stand up as she
  inadvertently moves it in front of the screen. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Whoa...</span><br />
  The screen begins to light up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... I guess this is supposed to happen.</span>
  <br />
  Annie looks back at the note. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">&#8216;Turn on main power switch on
  computer&apos;...</span>, she mumbles to herself.<br />
  She looks at the racks. They are mostly filled with what looks like
  large drawers with buttons on them. The one in the center is different.
  It has a bunch of empty panels, some panels with buttons and lights on
  them, and some other devices.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I found you a new floppy disk.</span> Isabelle
  interrupts her.<br />
  She pulls a large, square, floppy thing, half-wrapped in a paper sleeve,
  out of one of the boxes. She pulls the paper sleeve off. Turns out,
  it&apos;s another sleeve made out of thin plastic with some openings
  that were previously covered by the paper containing a black, glossy
  circle. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Lucas said to put it in the computer and push
  a lever down.</span><br />
  They look back and forth between the floppy disk and the computer until
  Isabelle points to a device in the center rack with a large, flat slot
  and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">It could fit in there.</span><br />
  She walks up to it and inserts the disk. Then, she pushes on the
  mechanism in the center of the slot. It latches in place.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s next?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The note says to turn on the &apos;main power
  switch&apos;</span>, Annie repeats while inspecting one of the panels
  with buttons.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maybe this one?</span><br />
  She points at a key switch. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s try.</span><br />
  Isabelle hands her the keys. One of them fits and turns.
</p>
<p>
  Fans come on; they hear the loud noise of air rushing through the
  computer. Some of the lights and buttons light up. Annie looks at the
  note again: <br />
  <span class="quote speech">&#8216;Spin up boot hard drive&apos;... Lucas
  has also written here: &apos;Number 2&apos;</span><br />
  The two look back at the racks.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">These drawer thingies here have numbers on
  them, maybe that&apos;s what they mean?</span><br />
  Isabelle presses the power button on number two. It starts blinking.
  The device makes a loud clonk noise followed by a motor accelerating
  inside. Clicking and more mechanical noises. The power switch stops
  blinking and stays lit up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">The last step on the note is to press
  &#8216;reset&apos; and &#8216;load&apos; and to enter something into the
  terminal. They also wrote down a list of commands that might help us to
  find and copy the manual, and &#8216;Good luck!&apos;...</span><br />
  Isabelle pushes the buttons and they walk over to the terminal.
</p>
<p>
  After a lot of typing into the terminal and figuring things out the hard
  way - and maybe a couple more cookies disappearing - they find the
  manual on one of the hard drives and manage to get it onto the floppy
  disk. They follow the instructions to turn the computer off and Annie
  puts the floppy disk back into its sleeve.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  might want to add that Annie takes the disk out of the drive before
  putting it back into its sleeve
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Shhh.</span><br />
  Isabelle gestures for Annie to be quiet. She whispers:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Do you hear that?</span><br />
  Footsteps. Annie nods. Someone is in the building - and probably heard
  them. Quickly, she puts the disk into her bag.
</p>
<p>
  Opening and closing the door as quietly as possible, they sneak out of
  the room and back towards the stairs. The footsteps are coming closer.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Shit</span>, Isabelle whispers.<br />
  They turn around and sneak to the other end of the hallway. It opens up
  into a room filled with crates that has small windows near the ceiling.
  The footsteps are making their way down the stairs. Annie reaches for
  one of the windows and opens it as quietly as possible while Isabelle
  moves one of the crates under it - not quite as quietly. The person on
  the stairs starts running. Isabelle jumps onto the crate and quickly
  climbs through the window. Annie, trying to follow her example,
  struggles for a moment to get onto the crate. After she finally manages
  to get up, Isabelle pulls her through the window - not a moment too soon.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">You, stop!</span>, <span class="comment">
  rephrase?? </span> a man yells at them from inside,
  <span class="quote speech">Stay where you are!</span><br />
  They start running. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m gonna catch you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Isabelle runs ahead, leading Annie into a dark alley. She climbs onto a
  ledge on the side of a building, pulling Annie up after herself. They
  continue running on the ledge until reaching a wall at the end of the
  alley. Isabelle jumps, grabs hold of the railing at the top, pulls
  herself up, and climbs over it. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wait here.</span> She disappears. <br />
  Annie looks around nervously. What if she was caught now? <br />
  A moment later, Isabelle returns holding a ladder. Annie climbs up and
  pulls the ladder up after herself. Isabelle takes it and stashes it on
  the other side of the embankment. Annie finds herself between the tracks
  of the metro. The Central Square station is close by, they run towards
  it along the tracks. Just as they make their way onto the platform, the
  rails start ringing. <br />
  Isabelle says with a smirk on her face:
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t think he expects our getaway
  vehicle to be yellow and red...</span>
