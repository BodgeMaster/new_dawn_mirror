<h1> New Dawn </h1>
<p>
  Welcome, reader! This website is basically a book that I am working
  on during my commute to work. It&apos;s an adventure story with sci-fi
  elements set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic world. Progress is
  kinda slow due to my limited time but if you&apos;re into this kind of
  stuff, feel free to hang around, I&apos;d appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Please give feedback.</b> I need it to turn what looks good to me into
  something that is actually passable. You can find me as @bodgemaster on
  Discord or @BodgeMaster.01 on Signal &ndash; please direct your feedback
  to my DMs or, if you have access to the story channel, there (you know
  who you are...).

  As the story is quite incomplete at this point, it might be helpful to
  know about the three main story lines:<br />
  The first one revolves around Jack who finds himself trapped in a bunker.
  In an attempt to get out, he establishes contact with the people in an
  underground dome city. The second story line follows Annie who finds
  Jack&apos;s message and sets out to help him which ultimately leads to
  her joining him in the outside world. The third story line begins in
  a space colony on the moon that they establish contact with over the
  course of the story.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing worth mentioning here: Parts of the story rely heavily
  on the use of computers. I plan on making these segments more
  self-explanatory so that deep knowledge will not be required.
  As of right now, it&apos;s a mixed bag. If anything is unclear,
  let me know.

  Below, in the table of contents, you find links to all the (already
  written) chapters. A good portion is incolmplete and a lot of them will
  be revised over time. The ones that don&apos;t have numbers are named
  so they show up in the right order but there is an unknown amount of
  chapters inbetween them.
