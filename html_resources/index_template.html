  Now with 100% more title! It might be a bit too on-the-nose tho, Idk.

  Welcome, reader! This website is basically a book that I am working
  on during my commute to work. It&apos;s an adventure story with sci-fi
  elements set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic world. Progress is
  kinda slow due to my limited time but if you&apos;re into this kind of
  stuff, feel free to hang around, I&apos;d appreciate it.

  <b>Please give feedback.</b> I need it to turn what looks good to me into
  something that is actually passable. You find me as @bodgemaster on
  Discord, please direct your feedback to my DMs or to the story channel
  if you have access to that (you know who you are :] ...).

  As the story is quite incomplete at this point, it might be helpful to
  know about the three main story lines:<br />
  The first one revolves around Jack who finds himself trapped in a bunker.
  In an attempt to get out, he establishes contact with the people in an
  underground dome city. The second story line follows Annie who finds
  Jack&apos;s message and sets out to help him which ultimately leads to
  her joining him in the outside world. The third story line begins in
  a space colony on the moon that they establish contact with over the
  course of the story.

  Another thing worth mentioning here: While parts of the story involve
  computers, intimate knowledge of them shouldn&apos;t be required. I make
  an effort to explain what&apos;s going on through context. If you find
  something unclear, let me know.

  Below, in the table of contents, you find links to all the (already
  written) chapters. A good portion is incolmplete and a lot of them will
  be revised over time. The ones that don&apos;t have numbers are named
  so they show up in the right order but there is an unknown amount of
  chapters inbetween them.
