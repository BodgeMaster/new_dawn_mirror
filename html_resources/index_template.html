<h1> &lt;Post Apocalypse Story&gt; </h1>
<p class="comment">
  Yeah, there is no real title yet.

<p>
  Welcome, reader! This website is basically a book that I am working on
  on the metro during my daily commute. It&apos;s an adventure story set
  in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic world. Progress is kinda slow due
  to my limited time but if you&apos;re into this kind of stuff, feel free
  to hang around, I&apos;d appreciate it, and <b>please give feedback</b>.
  I need it to turn what looks good to me into something that is actually
  passable. I&apos;m @bodgemaster on Discord, please direct your feedback
  to my DMs or to the story channel if you have access to that (you know
  who you are :] ...).

  Below, in the table of contents, you find links to all the chapters.
  There is also a <a href="./notes/">collection of notes</a> that, while not
  particularly well-maintained, might be interesting (in case you missed
  the link: <a href="./notes/">here</a>).
