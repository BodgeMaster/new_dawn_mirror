<p>
  &quot;Ahh fuck!&quot; Jack exclaims in pain as he wakes up. He has a
  terrible headache. As he moves his hands up to hold his head, he realizes
  that his entire body hurts. &quot;Owwowwowwowwoww... Ouch!&quot; <br />
  &quot;Emergency defrost complete. Entering low power mode.&quot;
  announces an automated voice. <br />
  He thinks to himself: &quot;Get it together, Jack! You knew this was
  gonna happen. You have trained for this. Where are the meds again?
  ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
  Waiting for the painkillers to kick in, Jack stays in his preservation
  chamber until he is fully awake. As he stands there, he looks out of the
  small window in the door. The bunker looks different from yesterday -
  not yesterday! That was how ever many years ago... Besides the point.
  It looks different. Not just &quot;things have moved around
  different&quot;, it looks almost like a lost place. Unexpected but
  whatever...
</p>
<p>
  The pressurized air hisses in the lines as the door of the preservation
  chamber swings aside. Jack steps out into the bunker, breathes the musty
  air, and looks around. The light shining out of his chamber reveals the
  dirty floor. The table and chairs in front of him, as well as the kitchen
  across the room, are covered in dust and all exposed bits of metal have
  rust. The red night lights on the ceiling are dimly illuminating the rest
  of the bunker. He looks to the left: The wall is lined with other
  preservation chambers, all except one of them being powered down. In
  front of the back wall are desks holding a radio, a terminal, and some
  <span class="comment"> need useful object here</span>. To the left of the
  desks in the corner is a minicomputer in a half-height rack and a
  teleprinter, and above it a phone on the wall - the usual Neotek
  equipment. He looks to the right: More preservation chambers. Instead of
  a wall, there&apos;s the bunker door - door is a bit of an
  understatement, it&apos;s a massive gate. A small slither of light
  passes under it. &quot;These fucking idiots... They didn&apos;t reseal it
  properly.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  He walks over to the door&apos;s control panel. The paint is flaking off
  revealing the rust underneath. Jack attempts to press a couple buttons
  but they get stuck and nothing happens. &quot;Fuck.&quot; He turns back
  to the inside of the bunker looking for tools, contemplating the tradeoff
  between waking up a couple years too soon and getting slowly poisoned by
  the air, and being locked inside a bunker due to a bunch of apparent
  troglodytes who are unable to close a door properly... Doesn&apos;t
  matter, too late now.
</p>
<p>
  As he passes each of the presevation chambers, he looks into them. Empty,
  empty, empty - nothing unexpected here. His own chamber... He presses a
  few buttons to fully shut it down. The lamp in the ceiling turns off,
  the door closes, the status lights turn off. After passing two other
  empty preservaton chambers, he reaches the one that remains active. <br />
  &quot;Hello Michelle.&quot; He checks the status lights of her chamber.
  &quot;I think I&apos;m gonna leave you in there for now. Should be
  fine...&quot; <br />
  He continues past the remaining empty chambers to the back of the bunker.
</p>
<p>
  The phone lifts off the wall with a quiet click and Jack begins to dial.
  He holds the receiver to his ear - silence. Welp, another thing that
  isn&apos;t working. He puts it back on the wall while turning to the
  terminal.
</p>
<p>
  Bonk! At least this seems to work. While waiting for the picture tube to
  warm up, he opens the lid on the teleprinter - only to find that
  something has eaten most of the paper. He removes what remains and opens
  one of the cabinets under the desks. By some miracle, the animal that ate
  the paper on the printer didn&apos;t find the rest. He takes a piece of
  the stack and tears it off. Then, he sets it on top of the desk with a
  thump. <span class="comment">need translation for &quot;Staub
  aufwirbeln&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
  The terminal screen reaches full brightness as Jack feeds the paper into
  the printer. He makes sure the holes on the feed ribbons line up with the
  mechanism, then he turns back to the terminal and begins to type.
