  <!--
    the fact that Mary sits in the front is already a given

  They drive on a dirt road alongside the dried-out <span class="comment">
  river name</span>. The road is in pretty poor condition and they get
  shaken thoroughly.<br />
  Mary appears to be having a blast:
  <span class="quote speech">Faster! Faster!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t think Annie would appreciate
  that.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Aww.</span><br />
  Annie says <span class="quote speech">thanks</span> from the rear seats.

    assumptions:
    - walking speed: 5km/h

  After a bit less than ten minutes of driving, Mary points to a structure
  extending into the river bed and says:
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s it.</span><br />
  Jack pulls over and parks the truck, and they get out. They walk through
  the tall grass towards the structure. A bridge further upstream catches
  Jack&apos;s attention.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is that a road or a railway?</span><br />
  Mary says: <span class="quote speech">Railway &ndash; why?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s the condition like?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not sure, it&apos;s been a while...
  We used to play there as kids, we even got a railcar to move once.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sounds like serviceable enough to me. Do you
  know where it goes?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a train station a bit that way,
  with a bunch of other ruins in the area.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">And the other direction?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t know. We followed it pretty far,
  the only thing we found is a switch.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay. Would be incredibly useful if that ended
  up somewhere in Ivydale.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They reach the structure. It&apos;s the entrance to a tunnel
  with a few walls that pertrude into the river and two
  <span class="comment">weers? translate: Stauwehre / Wehre</span>, one for
  controlling the <span class="comment">inflow? tanslate: Zufluss</span>,
  one for a bypass. The floor of the tunnel sits significantly beneath
  the river bed and, while the river bed is completely dry, there is still
  some water inside.
  
  <!--
    - trockenes Wehr am Einlass
    - water in the tunnel
    - bridge nearby
    - look at the large buried tank / branching point
    - go upstream to see where the river has gone
