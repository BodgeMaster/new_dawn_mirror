<h1> Wake Up! </h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Ahh fuck!</span> Jack exclaims in pain as he
  wakes up. He has a terrible headache. While moving his hands up to hold
  his head, he realizes that his entire body hurts.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Owwowwowwowwoww... Ouch!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Emergency defrost complete. Entering low power
  mode.</span> announces an automated voice. <br />
  He thinks: <span class="quote non-speech">Get it together, Jack!
  You knew this was gonna happen. You have trained for this. Where are the
  meds again? ...</span>
</p>
<p>
  Waiting for the painkillers to kick in, Jack stays in his preservation
  chamber until he is fully awake. As he stands there, looking out of the
  small window in the door, he notices something off. The bunker looks
  different from yesterday - not yesterday! That was years ago, probably
  decades... Besides the point. It looks different. Not just
  <span class="quote non-speech">things have moved around</span> different,
  it has the vibe of a full-on lost place. Unexpected but whatever...
</p>
<p>
  The pressurized air hisses in the lines as the door of the preservation
  chamber swings aside. Jack steps out into the bunker, breathes the musty
  air, and looks around. The light shining out of his chamber reveals the
  dirty floor. The table and chairs in front of him, as well as the kitchen
  across the room, are covered in dust and all exposed bits of metal have
  rust. The red night lights on the ceiling are dimly illuminating the rest
  of the bunker. He looks to the left: The wall is lined with other
  preservation chambers, all but one of them being powered down.
  In the corner is a minicomputer in a half-height rack and next to it a
  teleprinter. Along the rear wall are desks holding a radio, a terminal,
  and some boxes &ndash; and above them a phone on the wall &ndash; nothing
  out of the ordinary here. He looks to the right: More preservation
  chambers. Instead of a wall, there&apos;s the bunker door &ndash; door is
  a bit of an understatement, it&apos;s a massive gate. A small slither of
  light passes under it. <span class="quote speech">These fucking idiots...
  They didn&apos;t reseal it properly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  He walks over to the door&apos;s control panel. The paint is flaking off
  revealing the rust underneath. Jack attempts to press a couple buttons
  but they get stuck and nothing happens.
  <span class="quote speech">Fuck.</span>
  He turns back to the inside of the bunker looking for tools,
  contemplating the tradeoff between waking up a couple years too soon and
  getting slowly poisoned by the air, and being locked inside a bunker due
  to a bunch of apparent troglodytes who are unable to close a door
  properly... Doesn&apos;t matter, too late now.
</p>
<p>
  As he passes each of the presevation chambers, he looks into them. Empty,
  empty, empty - nothing unexpected here. His own chamber... He presses a
  few buttons to fully shut it down. The lamp in the ceiling turns off,
  the door closes, the status lights turn off. After passing two other
  empty preservaton chambers, he reaches the one that remains active.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hello Michelle.</span><br />
  He checks the status lights of her chamber.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think I&apos;m gonna leave you in there
  until I find a way out of here &mdash; should be fine...</span><br />
  He continues past the remaining empty chambers to the back of the bunker.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Jack opens the boxes on the desks looking for tools. He also rummages
  through the cabinets and drawers in the kitchen area.
  After finding some object that he could use as a screwdriver, he returns
  to the door, taking off the control panel. He realizes that he has no
  idea what he's doing so he attempts (and fails) to get the manual from
  the computer.
</p>
<p>
  Jack returns to the desk with the terminal. He flips the switch on the
  desk lamp. It flickers for a moment and turns off again. He leans over
  the terminal and pushes the power switch &ndash; Bonk! At least this
  seems to work. While waiting for the picture tube to warm up, he walks
  over to the rack and sits down on the floor in front of it. He inspects
  the status lights on the various devices thinking aloud:
  <span class="quote speech">CPU is idle, serials are idle, cryogenics
  control unit sees one active chamber, primary hard drive is powered up
  &ndash; all good. Secondary hard drive is powered down, let&apos;s
  change that...</span>
  He pushes the power button and hears the spindle spinning up. The power
  button blinks. There is some intermittent rattling from the drive,
  probably a shot bearing. He hears the platters inside accelerate for an
  unusually long time. Impatiently sitting there, Jack waits for the drive
  to be ready. Clicking from the mechanism unlocking the heads followed by
  a ringing scratching noise. <span class="quote speech">Of course.</span>
  He quickly presses the power button again. The scratching stops and the
  spindle motor turns off, followed by the platters slowly decelerating.
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s gonna be an ugly head
  crash.</span>
</p>
<p>
  He gets up and walks over to the phone. Maybe, the lines to
  &lt;dome city&gt; still work. Not exactly excited by the prospect of
  calling random people, but not seeing another option, he reaches for
  the receiver. It lifts off the wall with a quiet click and Jack begins
  to dial. He holds the receiver to his ear - silence.
  <span class="quote speech">Welp, that&apos;s that.</span> He puts it
  back on the wall.
