<h1> Wake Up! </h1>
<!-- perspective: Jack -->
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Awh fuck!</span><br />
  Jack exclaims in pain as he wakes up. He has a terrible headache.
  While moving his hands up to hold his head, he realizes that his entire
  body hurts.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Owowowww... Ouch!</span><br />
  An automated voice comes on: <span class="quote speech">Emergency
  defrost complete. Entering low power mode.</span><br />
  He thinks: <span class="quote non-speech">Get it together, Jack!
  You knew this could happen. You have trained for this. Where are the
  meds again? ...</span>
</p>
<p>
  Waiting for the painkillers to kick in, he stays in his preservation
  chamber until he is fully awake. As he stands there, looking out of the
  small window in the door, he notices something off. The bunker looks
  different from yesterday - not yesterday! That was years ago, probably
  decades... Besides the point. It looks different. Not just
  <span class="quote non-speech">things have moved around</span> different,
  it gives off the vibe of a full-on lost place. Unexpected, but he brushes
  the thought aside for the moment...
</p>
<p>
  The pressurized air hisses in the lines as the door of the preservation
  chamber swings aside. Jack steps out into the bunker, breathes the musty
  air, and looks around. The light shining out of his chamber reveals a
  dirty floor. The table and chairs in front of him as well as the kitchen
  area across the room are covered in dust and all exposed bits of metal
  are rusty. The paint is starting to flake off of the walls. Red night
  lights on the ceiling are dimly illuminating the rest of the bunker.
  He looks to the left: The wall is lined with other preservation chambers,
  all but one of them being powered down. In the corner is the minicomputer
  controlling the bunker, a half-height rack filled to the brim with
  devices, and next to it a teleprinter, a computer-controlled typewriter.
  Along the rear wall are desks holding a radio and a terminal (a device
  comprised of a keyboard and monitor), and on the wall above them is a
  phone; nothing out of the ordinary here &ndash; apart from a few paint
  crumbs sprinkled on everything. He looks to the right: More preservation
  chambers. Instead of a wall, there&apos;s the bunker door &ndash; door
  is a bit of an understatement, it&apos;s a massive gate. A small slither
  of light passes under it.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">These fucking idiots... They didn&apos;t
  reseal it properly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  He walks over to the door&apos;s control panel. The paint is flaking off
  revealing the rust underneath. Jack attempts to press a couple buttons
  but they get stuck and nothing happens. A bunch of expletives and some
  banging on the panel later, he turns back to the inside of the bunker,
  looking for tools, contemplating the tradeoff between waking up a couple
  years too soon and getting slowly poisoned by the air, and being locked
  inside a bunker due to a bunch of apparent troglodytes being unable to
  close a door properly... Doesn&apos;t matter now, too late.
</p>
<p>
  As he passes each of the preservation chambers, he looks into them. Empty,
  empty, empty - nothing unexpected here. The others would have been woken
  up over time. His own chamber... He presses a few buttons to fully shut
  it down. The lamp in its ceiling turns off, the door closes, the status
  lights turn off. After passing two other empty preservaton chambers, he
  reaches the one that remains active.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hello Michelle</span>, he says more to himself
  than to the frozen person inside.<br />
  He checks the status lights of her chamber.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks good to me &mdash; I think I&apos;m
  gonna leave you in there until I find a way out...</span><br />
  He continues past the remaining empty chambers to the back of the bunker.
</p>
<p>
  Jack opens the cabinets under each of the desks while talking to himself:
  <span class="quote speech">Where is that fucking toolbox?</span><br />
  Well, it isn&apos;t there. He continues with the kitchen area. Still
  nothing. He enters the bathroom through a door next to the kitchen area.
  Nope, not here either.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Welp, time to improvise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack returns to the kitchen area and rummages through the drawers
  to find anything useful. He grabs a fork.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Works as a screwdriver, I guess...</span><br />
  He proceeds to jam the handle into a screw on one of the kitchen cabinets
  to see if it will turn. It does &ndash; barely. Using a slightly rusty
  sharpening rod he begins the long and arduous process of grinding the
  fork handle flat, dragging it across the rod over and over and over
  again. After a while, he stops to inspect his work.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Meh, could work.</span><br />
  He tests it on the cabinet again.
</p>
<p>
  His newly gained screwdriver in hand, Jack walks back to the control
  panel for the door and unscrews it. After a bit of fiddling with it,
  the panel lifts out of its niche in the wall, pulling cables out of the
  box under it. He grabs the fork by the handle and bends the inner prongs
  out of the way. Then, he bridges the switch contacts using the two outer
  prongs. Nothing happens.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Of course it wasn't gonna be that easy.</span>
  <br />
  He starts to dig into the wires, attempting to find what&apos;s wrong,
  but realizes after a moment that the wiring is more complex than expected
  and he has no idea what he&apos;s doing.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Guess I need the manual for this
  thing...</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack walks over to the desk with the terminal and flips the switch on the
  desk lamp. It flickers for a moment before turning off again. He flips
  the switch back and leans over the terminal to turn it on &ndash;
  Bonk! At least this seems to work. While waiting for the picture tube to
  warm up, he walks over to the rack and sits down on the floor in front
  of it. He inspects the status lights on the various devices, thinking
  aloud:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">CPU is idle, serials are idle, one active
  preservation chamber &ndash; all good. Primary hard drive is up, second
  hard drive is ... powered off? Let&apos;s change that...</span><br />
  He pushes the power button and hears the fans blow air through the drive.
  The spin-up button starts blinking. He waits for a moment to let the fans
  blow away any dust that may have settled inside the drive, then he pushes
  it. The button lights up solid and the motor inside kicks on. There
  is some intermittent rattling from the drive,
  <span class="quote non-speech">probably a shot bearing</span>, he thinks.
  He hears the spindle inside accelerating unusually slowly. Impatiently
  sitting there, he waits for the drive to be ready. Clicking from inside
  the drive followed by a ringing scratching noise.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Of course!</span><br />
  He quickly presses the power button again. The scratching stops and
  the motor turns off, the spindle still rattling occasionally as it spins
  down.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s gonna be an ugly head crash.
  No manuals for me, I guess...</span>
</p>
<p>
  He gets up and returns to the terminal, thinking there might be
  something useful, maybe even a backup, on the primary drive.
  He pulls a nearby chair in front of it and sits down.

  <span class="quote speech">So it&apos;s been over a hundred years...
  Hm.</span><br />
  He goes through the files but nothing useful turns up. He does, however,
  find a note from 2030 saying that the inhabitants of the dome city
  have proven to be unhelpful when asked for assistance. Too bad they are
  the ones that have a full backup of everything &ndash; assuming there is
  anyone still living there.
</p>
<p>
  He gets up and reaches for the phone. It lifts off the cradle with a
  quiet click. Jack holds it to his ear and starts dialing but there is no
  dial tone.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Welp, that&apos;s that.</span>
