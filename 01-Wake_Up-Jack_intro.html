<h1> Wake Up! </h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Awh fuck!</span> Jack exclaims in pain as he
  wakes up. He has a terrible headache. While moving his hands up to hold
  his head, he realizes that his entire body hurts.
  <span class="quote speech">Owowowww... Ouch!</span><br />
  An automated voice comes on: <span class="quote speech">Emergency
  defrost complete. Entering low power mode.</span><br />
  He thinks: <span class="quote non-speech">Get it together, Jack!
  You knew this was gonna happen. You have trained for this. Where are the
  meds again? ...</span>
</p>
<p>
  Waiting for the painkillers to kick in, he stays in his preservation
  chamber until he is fully awake. As he stands there, looking out of the
  small window in the door, he notices something off. The bunker looks
  different from yesterday - not yesterday! That was years ago, probably
  decades... Besides the point. It looks different. Not just
  <span class="quote non-speech">things have moved around</span> different,
  it gives off the vibe of a full-on lost place. Unexpected but whatever...
</p>
<p>
  The pressurized air hisses in the lines as the door of the preservation
  chamber swings aside. Jack steps out into the bunker, breathes the musty
  air, and looks around. The light shining out of his chamber reveals a
  dirty floor. The table and chairs in front of him as well as the kitchen
  area across the room are covered in dust and all exposed bits of metal
  have rust. The red night lights on the ceiling are dimly illuminating
  the rest of the bunker. He looks to the left: The wall is lined with
  other preservation chambers, all but one of them being powered down.
  In the corner is the minicomputer controlling the bunker, a half-height
  rack filled to the brim with devices, and next to it a teleprinter, a
  computer-controlled typewriter. Along the rear wall are desks holding a
  radio and a terminal, a device with a keyboard and a screen, and above
  them a phone on the wall &ndash; nothing out of the ordinary here.
  He looks to the right: More preservation chambers. Instead of a wall,
  there&apos;s the bunker door &ndash; door is a bit of an understatement,
  it&apos;s a massive gate. A small slither of light passes under it.
  <span class="quote speech">These fucking idiots... They didn&apos;t
  reseal it properly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  He walks over to the door&apos;s control panel. The paint is flaking off
  revealing the rust underneath. Jack attempts to press a couple buttons
  but they get stuck and nothing happens. A bunch of expletives and some
  banging on the panel later, he turns back to the inside of the bunker,
  looking for tools, contemplating the tradeoff between waking up a couple
  years too soon and getting slowly poisoned by the air, and being locked
  inside a bunker due to a bunch of apparent troglodytes unable to close a
  door properly... Doesn&apos;t matter, too late now.
</p>
<p>
  As he passes each of the presevation chambers, he looks into them. Empty,
  empty, empty - nothing unexpected here. The others would have been woken
  up over time. His own chamber... He presses a few buttons to fully shut
  it down. The lamp in the ceiling turns off, the door closes, the status
  lights turn off. After passing two other empty preservaton chambers, he
  reaches the one that remains active.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hello Michelle.</span><br />
  He checks the status lights of her chamber.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think I&apos;m gonna leave you in there
  until I find a way out of here &mdash; should be fine...</span><br />
  He continues past the remaining empty chambers to the back of the bunker.
</p>
<p>
  Jack opens the cabinets under each of the desks while talking to himself:
  <span class="quote speech">Where is that fucking toolbox?</span>
  <span class="comment">Do we have an alternative expletive to use?</span>
  Well, it isn&apos;t there. He continues with the kitchen area. Still
  nothing. He enters the bathroom through a door next to the kitchen area.
  Nope, not here either. <span class="quote speech">Welp, time to
  improvise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack returns to the kitchen area and rummages through the drawers to find
  anything useful. He grabs a fork. <span class="quote speech">Works as a
  screwdriver, I guess...</span> He proceeds to jam the handle into a
  screw on one of the kitchen cabinets to see if it will turn. It does
  &ndash; barely. Using a slightly rusty knife sharpener
  <span class="comment">sharpening rod?</span> he begins the long and
  arduous process of making the fork handle more suitable as a screwdriver,
  grinding the end over the sharpener over and over and over. After a
  while, he stops to inspect his work. <span class="quote speech">Meh,
  could work.</span> He tests it on the kitchen cabinet again.
</p>
<p>
  His newly gained screwdriver in hand, Jack walks back to the control panel
  for the door and unscrews it. After a bit of fiddling, the panel lifts
  out of the niche in the wall, pulling cables out of the box under it.
  He grabs the fork by the handle and bends the <span class="comment">
  middle? inner?</span> prongs out of the way to bridge the control
  panel&apos;s switches using the outer prongs. Nothing happens.
  <span class="quote speech">Of course it wasn't gonna be that easy.</span>
  He starts to dig into the wires, attempting to find the fault, but
  realizes after a moment that the wiring is more complex than expected
  and he has no idea what he&apos;s doing.
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s get the manual for this
  thing...</span> <span class="comment">He probably wouldn&apos;t say it
  like that while talking to himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack walks over to the desk with the terminal and flips the switch on the
  desk lamp. It flickers for a moment before turning off again. He flips
  the switch back and leans over the terminal to turn it on &ndash;
  Bonk! At least this seems to work. While waiting for the picture tube to
  warm up, he walks over to the rack and sits down on the floor in front
  of it. He inspects the status lights on the various devices, thinking
  aloud: <span class="quote speech">CPU is idle, serials are idle,
  one active cryogenic chamber, primary hard drive is spinning &ndash;
  all good. Secondary hard drive is powered down, let&apos;s change
  that...</span> He pushes the power button and hears the fans kick in.
  The spin-up button starts blinking. He waits for a moment to let the
  fans blow away any dust that may have settled inside the drive, then he
  pushes it. The spindle motor kicks on. There is some intermittent
  rattling from the drive, probably a shot bearing. He hears the platters
  inside accelerate unusually slowly. Impatiently sitting there, Jack waits
  for the drive to be ready. Clicking from the mechanism unlocking the
  heads followed by a ringing scratching noise.
  <span class="quote speech">Of course...</span> He quickly presses the
  power button again. The scratching stops and the spindle motor turns off,
  the spindle still rattling occasionally as the platters spin down.
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s gonna be an ugly head crash.
  No manuals for me, I guess...</span>
</p>
<p>
  He gets up and walks over to the phone. Maybe, the lines to
  &lt;dome city&gt; still work. Not exactly excited by the prospect of
  calling random people, but not seeing another option, he reaches for
  the receiver. It lifts off the wall with a quiet click and Jack begins
  to dial. He holds the receiver to his ear - silence.
  <span class="quote speech">Welp, that&apos;s that.</span> He puts it
  back on the wall.
</p>
<p>
  In an attempt to find anything useful, he sits down at the terminal and
  logs on.

  <span class="quote speech">So it&apos;s been over a hundred years,
  hm...</span> He starts going through the files, hoping he misremembered
  where the manuals were stored, but to no avail, they are gone.
