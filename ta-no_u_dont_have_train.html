<h1> No U Don&apos;t Have Train. </h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Why wouldn&apos;t they work outside? It&apos;s
  not like they&apos;re magically gonna come off the rails once they leave
  the dome.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">All of your trains are outfitted with fail-safe
  emergency brakes. On power loss, you have about 15 seconds before they
  are applied and the train comes to an abrupt, unscheduled halt.
  You can&apos;t even tow these things without power.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I thought you said the tracks were in decent
  shape? Why would the <span class="comment">contacts? sliders?</span>
  come off the power rail for that long?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">A) I didn&apos;t, I said they are in
  <i>surprisingly</i> decent shape after being exposed to the elements
  for a century without any maintenance. B) That power rail isn&apos;t
  gonna be of any use because it doesn&apos;t deliver any power.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">What do you mean? Why not?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Where does the rail get its power from?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">The power grid.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not quite, but close enough. What do we not
  have outside?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Of course there is a power grid outside.
  It&apos;s what powered the old world just as ours powers the city.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">There used to be one, that much is correct,
  but it hasn&apos;t been used or maintained in a century. Even if you did
  somehow manage to get part of it working, I still wouldn&apos;t trust it.
  And where would you wanna get the electricity to run it from?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">From a substation. We fix up one of those and
  use it to power the grid.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Great, now you have a local grid attached to
  the high voltage grid. And what do you wanna power that with?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What? The substations make the power.
  It&apos;s where all the power in the city comes from: Two substations
  &ndash; one in the wall next to this airlock and the other one is by
  the other airlock.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There is a third one deep below Central
  Square. These are indeed where the electricity in the city comes from
  but they don&apos;t make it. They get it from a power plant outside,
  a bit northeast of here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The dome powered by the outside world?
  People be believing strange things these days...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t have to believe. I was there when
  the city was built and, more recently, I helped replace a failing
  generator at said power plant. You might have noticed the power
  outage.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhuh, sure buddy. Since you&apos;ve been doing
  nothing but spewing nonsense all this time, I&apos;m just gonna have one
  of our guys drive a train up there and we&apos;ll see what happens.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;ll get some popcorn; watching this is
  gonna be fun. Wouldn&apos;t be the first time a train got stuck in these
  tunnels...</span>
