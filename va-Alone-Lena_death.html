  Emily and Lena start putting on their space suits. Emily is done
  relatively quickly while Lena makes slow progress as she struggles to
  keep her balance. Half-way through, she gives up, sitting down on the
  bench across from the air lock. Emily helps her all the way into the
  suit. Lena sits there for a moment, heavily breathing, while Emily waits.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sorry, I can&apos;t... I feel exhausted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Emily takes their helmets and brings them into the airlock. She returns
  for a life support unit, pulls it out of the rack in the wall, and sets
  it down on the floor. Following a mental checklist, she makes sure that
  the air tank is connected properly and the status display reads what it
  should. Everything okay... or is it? She double-checks with the check
  list on the wall. Yes, this unit is ready. She triple-checks everything
  &ndash; first time it actually matters. Reasonably satisfied with her
  findings, she carries it over to the air lock. Then, she repeats this
  procedure for the second unit. Finally, she helps Lena up and they get
  into the airlock.
</p>
<p>
  The pumps are getting quieter and quieter. Lena kneels on the floor
  holding a bunch of flowers from the biotope module, her life support
  unit next to her on a short tether. Emily puts it on her back and and
  helps her up. The outer door of the airlock swings aside and they start
  walking, Lena leaning on Emily.
</p>
<p>
  They reach the graveyard and walk over to the recent graves. The entire
  graveyard is covered in hills where the bodies of the deceased were
  buried. Some have signs with names, some have painted pieces of regalith
  as gravestones, some have <span class="comment">&lt;the crumpled remains
  of&gt;? What happens to flowers when exposed to vacuum for a prolonged
  amount of time?</span> flowers next to them, some are entirely
  undecorated.
</p>
<p>
  Lena places a couple flowers on each of the most recent graves, then she
  gestures for Emily to take the life support unit off her back. Emily
  takes it off and she sits down. Emily places the life support unit
  behind her, Lena leans against it. She turns her radio on and Emily does
  the same.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ultimately, you were right.</span> She is
  interrupted by coughing. <span class="quote speech">If more had taken
  Tony&apos;s cure &ndash; no matter what risk it posed ... &ndash; maybe
  some of them would be alive now.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What about you?</span> Emily asks with a
  slither of hope in her voice.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No &ndash; no cure can save me, it&apos;s too
  late.</span><br />
  Emily tears up. <span class="comment">note: Slightly. Is there a better
  way to say this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m sorry.</span><br />
  Lena raises her arm. Emily sits down next to her and Lena puts it around
  her shoulders.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What will I do without you?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You have a strong mind. You got this. Jack
  will call in the evening, as usual; he will know what to do next.</span>

</ul>
<p>
  The conversation is interrupted by the beeping of Lena&apos;s low oxygen
  alarm going off. Emily gets up and walks back to the habitat. She enters
  through the airlock and looks for a full oxygen bottle. She lifts one
  out of its rack and carries it back to Lena. She opens the life support
  unit and closes the valves on it and the empty bottle, then she replaces
  it and opens the valves again. Just as she is done with that, her own
  alarm goes off. <span class="comment">Disappointed/annoyed reaction</span>
</p>
<p>
  Emily looks at Lena &ndash; she had closed her eyes. As if she knew Emily
  was looking she opens them, looking directly at her.
  <span class="comment">Gripping?</span> her hand as she speaks.
  <span class="comment">some meaningful last words?</span> Then she lets go
  and closes her eyes again. A couple minutes later, she stops breathing.
  <span class="comment">wording?</span>
