<h1>Banished</h1>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Isabelle!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Lucas!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I got banished.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What...?</span><br />
  The guard behind Isabelle gives her a stern look, the one in front of her
  turns around:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No chit-chat, move along.</span><br />
  Isabelle takes a moment to understand the implication of what Lucas had
  said.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">...ohhhhh. Congrats!</span><br />
  The guards grab her by the arms and drag her away.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Move.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They bring her to a room adjacent to the main court room where a bunch
  of important-looking people in suits are waiting for her. They introduce
  themselves and they all, including herself, sit down around a somewhat
  large table. One of the suits takes the word:<br />
  <span class="comment">Does that work in English?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Under normal circumstances, robbery,
  compromising operationally critical systems, and conspiracy of terrorism
  would land you in <span class="comment">jail? prison?</span> for a long
  time. We&apos;re willing to make an exception here since you caused rather
  little actual harm &ndash; if you are willing to accept this deal...</span>
  <br />
  He grabs few sheets of paper from his bag <span class="comment">
  Aktentasche?</span> and slides them over.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Basically admit to everything you&apos;re
  accused of and you will get to leave Sunside Cove. You&apos;ll be free
  as long as you never come back.</span><br />
  She absentmindedly acknowledges what he said as she is already reading
  the first page.<br />
  <span class="comment">Isabelle questions the deal.<br />
  What about bogus charge xyz? take it or leave it<br />
  What are they trying to get out of this deal? avoiding controversy and
  removing her from the city<br />
  Are they going to honor it?

<p class="comment">
  Note: It was always intended that at least some of the rebels who got
  caught will be released to the outside. However, before starting this
  chapter, I have never actually considered what this means for the rest
  of the story. The following chapters weren&apos;t originally written
  with this in mind and may need to be revised to take it into account.
