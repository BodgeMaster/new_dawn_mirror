<h1>Banished</h1>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Isabelle!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Lucas!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I got banished.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What...?</span><br />
  The guard behind Isabelle gives her a stern look, the one in front of her
  turns around:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No chit-chat, move along.</span><br />
  Isabelle takes a moment to understand the implication of what Lucas had
  said.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">...ohhhhh. Congrats!</span><br />
  The guards grab her by the arms and drag her away.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Move.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They bring her to a room adjacent to the main court room where a bunch
  of important-looking people in suits are waiting for her. They introduce
  themselves and they all, including herself, sit down around a somewhat
  large table. One of the suits takes the word:<br />
  <span class="comment">Does that work in English?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Before you go to trial, we have something
  to discuss with you. You are being accused of breaking and entering,
  robbery, interfering with law enforcement, compromising operationally
  critical systems, and conspiracy of terrorism. Some of these charges
  alone will land you in prison for a long time &ndash; unless you take
  this deal...</span><br />
  He grabs few sheets of paper from his bag <span class="comment">
  Aktentasche?</span> and slides them over.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Basically admit to everything you&apos;re
  accused of and you will be banished instead of going to prison.</span>
  <br />
  She absentmindedly acknowledges what he said as she is already reading
  the first page.<br />
  After reading it, she says: <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s
  a bunch of things in here that aren&apos;t true.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Take it or leave it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What are you getting out of this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">We don&apos;t want troublemakers like you
  here &ndash; nor do we want controversy.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What will happen if I sign this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You will be removed from Sunside Cove.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">And in practical terms?</span><br />
  Another one of the suits answers:
  <span class="quote speech">There is an ongoing power outage to parts
  of the city. We will have to send a group of people
  <span class="comment">delegation?</span> outside to fix it.
  You will join them and not return.</span><br />
  She looks back at the pages.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okaay.</span><br />
  The other pages are some half filled-out forms. She is given a pen and
  told to fill in the rest.

<p class="comment">
  Note: It was always intended that at least some of the rebels who got
  caught will be released to the outside. However, before starting this
  chapter, I have never actually considered what this means for the rest
  of the story. The following chapters weren&apos;t originally written
  with this in mind and may need to be revised to take it into account.
