<h1>Banished</h1>
<!-- Perspective: Isabelle -->

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Isabelle!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Lucas!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I got banished.</span>, he says with
  a shit-eating grin on his face.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What...?</span><br />
  The guard behind Isabelle gives her a stern look, the one in front of her
  turns around:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No chit-chat, move along.</span><br />
  Isabelle takes a moment to understand the implication of what Lucas had
  said.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">...ohhhhh. Congrats!</span><br />
  The guards grab her by the arms and drag her away.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Move!</span>
</p>
<p>
  They bring her to a room adjacent to the main court room where a bunch
  of important-looking people in suits are waiting for her. They introduce
  themselves and they all, including herself, sit down around a somewhat
  large table. One of the suits addresses her:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Before you go to trial, we have something
  to discuss with you. You are being accused of breaking and entering,
  property theft, interfering with law enforcement, compromising
  operationally critical systems, and conspiracy of terrorism. Some of
  these charges alone will land you in prison for a long time &ndash;
  unless you take this deal...</span><br />
  He grabs few sheets of paper from his briefcase and slides them over.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Basically admit to everything you&apos;re
  accused of and you will be banished instead of going to prison.</span>
  <br />
  She absentmindedly acknowledges what he said as she is already reading
  the first page.<br />
  After reading it, she says: <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s
  a bunch of things in here that aren&apos;t true.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Take it or leave it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What are you getting out of this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">We don&apos;t want people like you here.
  You cause too much trouble.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What will happen if I sign this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You will be removed from Sunside Cove.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s what it says. And in practical
  terms?</span><br />
  Another one of the suits answers:
  <span class="quote speech">There is an ongoing power outage to parts
  of the city. We will have to send an expedition outside to fix it.
  You will join them and not return.</span><br />
  She looks back at the pages.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... Okay...</span><br />
  The other pages are some half filled-out forms. She is given a pen and
  told to fill in the rest.
</p>
<p>
  Not much later, she finds herself at trial. As laid out in the paperwork,
  she gets banished. She is almost kinda surprised it wasn&apos;t
  a trick, but also relieved.
</p>
<p>
  Isabelle is taken to a cell with no bed or toilet, just a bench.
  She sits down and waits. The guard leaves and the hallway gets quiet.
  The only thing she hears is the hum of the flourescent lights.
  She waits some more. Time passes.
</p>
<p>
  The lights go out. Relays click in the hallway. She tries to look
  around. The streetlight outside the tiny cell window projects a small
  shimmer onto the ceiling that slowly fades until she is surrounded by
  complete darkness. It gets even quieter than it was already &ndash; not
  even a noise from outside.
</p>
<p>
  After quite some time, she hears a door open. A guard comes walking down
  the hallway, looking into all the cells with a flashlight.<br />
  He arrives at her holding cell and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Good afternoon.</span> while opening the
  door, pointing his flashlight back where he came from.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That way. Someone will be with you
  shortly.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">You&apos;re just gonna let me go by
  myself?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There aren&apos;t that many places you could
  run off to. Now go.</span><br />
  She gets up and does as she is told. The diffuse light reflecting off
  the floor and the walls lets her barely see her surroundings. Another
  gaurd appears in the door at the end of the hallway, holding
  a flashlight as well.
</p>
<p>
  She is cuffed and brought to a car where two other guards are waiting.
  It&apos;s a short ride from the prison to the nearest train station.
  Apart from a few cars moving around, the entire area is completely dark.
  No steetlights, no lit-up windows. It is dark enough that she can see
  a faint shimmer on the dome ceiling, reflecting the light from other
  parts of the city.
</p>
<p>
  A train is waiting at the platform. Rather than the usual metro, this one
  is made up of a battery locomotive and a few flat bed cars. The guard
  hands the key to her handcuffs over to a guy who seems to be in charge.
  They sign some paperwork. Then, the guard leaves and the guy tells her
  to go sit on the last car at the end of the train.
</p>
<p>
  A few minutes later, the same repeats with Lucas. He sits down next to
  her and they start quietly chatting.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Any idea who else is gonna join us
  here?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">dialog here</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Note: It was always intended that at least some of the rebels who got
  caught will be released to the outside. However, before starting this
  chapter, I have never actually considered what this means for the rest
  of the story. The following chapters weren&apos;t originally written
  with this in mind and may need to be significantly revised to take it
  into account.
