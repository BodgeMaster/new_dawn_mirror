<h1> Internet Saboteur </h1>
<!--
  Outline:
  - Annie goes to basement
  - she finds a sign on the telephone
  - she waits for Jack to dial in
  - they talk
  - she leaves for the invitation she got
-->
<p>
  Annie walks down the stairs to the basement and turns on the lights.
  She goes back to the small office space with the terminal where she
  finds a sticky note on the screen:
  <span class="quote non-speech">Trying to sabotage the network or what?
  That phone stays unplugged.</span>
  She takes the note off the screen and sits down. She finds a pen and
  scribbles on it: <span class="quote non-speech">Sorry</span>
</p>
<p>
  The terminal screen is dark. She looks for a way to turn it on.
  There&apos;s a power switch on the side but that&apos;s already on.
  That <span class="quote non-speech">RDY</span> light is lit up.
  She tries pressing a random letter. The screen crackles as it gets
  energized and it slowly lights up.
  The <span class="quote non-speech">RDY</span> light goes out.

  It appears that Jack isn&apos;t there yet. Annie waits for a moment,
  before she gets bored and gets up to grab some cookies from the break
  room. Cookies in hand, she swings by her office to grab a few sheets of
  paper and a pen. Then, she goes back downstairs and sits at the terminal
  desk. The screen had gone out again so she presses another button.
  Still nothing. She makes some space on the desk, folds the paper
  in half and starts drawing.
</p>
<p>
  Just as she gets started, the terminal comes alive. The screen lights up
  and it makes a beep.

  chapter 2</span>

<!--
  What do they talk about? Need to collect questions.
  - Questions about the old world?
  - "But isn't the outside toxic?"
  - short introduction on how to use shift/bksp/return
  - Reason for Jack to be there
  - bunker functions (computer, phone, food supply, preservation chambers
  - personal details?
-->

<b>Jack&gt;</b> Hi.
<b>Jack&gt;</b> So I made a little program that should make it easier to chat...
<b>Jack&gt;</b> Anyway, am here. You there?
<b>Annnie&gt;</b> yes
<span class="comment">add some kinda small talk or no?</span>
<b>Jack&gt;</b> You said you had questions... Ask away.
<b>Annie&gt;</b> my grandpa said you were frozen in your bunker   how and why
<b>Jack&gt;</b> That is a great over-simplification, but yes. I don&apos;t know how it actually
  works. People much smarter than me figured it out very late into the disaster.
<b>Jack&gt;</b> As for why... I am part of a ground support team for the Lunar Biosphere
  Project. Our task is to wait until needed, and then use the abandoned
  infrastructure to the best of our abilities to assist them.
<b>Annie&gt;</b> there are other people with you
<b>Jack&gt;</b> Well yes and no. One of them is left. I&apos;ll leave her frozen until I get
  this door open, don&apos;t think she&apos;d deal well with this siuation.
<b>Annie&gt;</b> what happened to the rest
<b>Jack&gt;</b> They were called up, went outside, and fulfilled their mission.
<b>Annie&gt;</b> isnt the outside toxic
<b>Jack&gt;</b> It was. Reading the logbook, it seems that things were mostly fine again
  by around 2050.
<b>Annie&gt;</b> people here think its still impossible to live there
<b>Annie&gt;</b> they taught us in school that there are deadly chemicals in the air
<b>Jack&gt;</b> That was true at one point, a long time ago. How much do you know about
  the disaster?
<b>Annie&gt;</b> not much  just that it happened and the result
<b>Jack&gt;</b> <span class="comment">Jack gives a quick rundown of what happened, can be one of:
  - mining sludge dam broke and there was a chemical plant downstream
  - something started cooking off underground like Centralia
  - ??? (need more options to decide)</span>
