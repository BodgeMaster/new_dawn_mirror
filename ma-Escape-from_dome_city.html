<h1> Escape</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->
<p>
  Annie reaches the platform. The sirens of the police cars are really
  close now. A train is coming. The first police car arrives at the
  station. Annie freezes as she panics. The train for sure won&apos;t
  leave before the police searched it. Where can she hide?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Annie!</span> Someone shouts her name.
  <span class="quote speech">Get in here, run!</span><br />
  She breaks out of her freeze. The train had turned out to be a single
  car. A single, slightly rusty railcar painted in shades of dark
  blue. <span class="comment">note: make it a theme that the metro is
  always yellow and red</span> The only person inside is the guy who had
  called out to her, turning away from the door he had just opened.
  His Neotek jacket flaps in the air as he runs towards the other end of
  the train &ndash; that has to be Jack. The motors begin to hum while
  Annie is still running towards the open door. She jumps inside as the
  train starts moving back in the direction it came from. The door closes
  just after leaving the platform.
</p>
<p>
  The train accelerates with a force stronger than anything she has ever
  felt before. The motors scream, the entire train rattles. While making
  her way to the front, she looks outside. The city flies by. The horn
  sounds as the train barrels through the next station. The platform
  appears, is visible just long enough to see the astonished faces of
  the onlookers, and disappears again.
</p>
<p>
  She reaches the driver&apos;s cabin.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hello Jack!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hi Annie &ndash; you good?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes</span>, she breathes heavily,
  <span class="quote speech">but that was close.</span><br />
  After catching her breath for a moment, she says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">You arrived just in time. They&apos;ve been
  following me around for a while but we got away.</span><br />
  Jack seems to think for a short moment while his eyes stay fixated on the
  track ahead.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That remains to be seen. Coming through that
  airlock seems to have set off some sort of alarm; like poking a stick
  into an anthill...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">An anthill?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh, I forgot, you wouldn&apos;t know... Ants
  are tiny little animals. They build hills of loose material as their
  nests. If you poke a stick into one, they scramble to defend it.</span>
  <br />
  Annie imagines a bunch of mice scratching and biting away at a stick
  that&apos;s stuck in a slope of rubble.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Anyway</span>, Jack continues,
  <span class="quote speech">this little expedition hasn&apos;t gone
  unnoticed.</span><br />
  Short pause.
</p>
<p>
  Looking outside again, Annie realizes:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I have never seen one of these</span> &ndash;
  she knocks on the control panel &ndash; <span class="quote speech">go
  this fast.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Me neither</span>, says Jack. He adds:
  <span class="quote speech">There used to be trains that could go faster
  &ndash; a lot faster &ndash; but not the metro.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After watching the tracks, stations, and buildings fly by for a couple
  minutes, Annie opens her bag and pulls out a pile of paper.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Here are the documents you need. Maps,
  blueprints, manuals, everything we could find.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sounds good. Just put them in there for
  now.</span><br />
  He gestures towards a small cabinet on the wall behind them.
  Annie places the pile on top of a few books and binders already
  inside.
</p>
<p>
  The train barrels through another station. Jack decelerates slowly,
  saying:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re almost at your drop-off point, next
  station is Crystal Park ... uhhh ... and we might have a problem.</span>
  <br />
  The train is going around a long curve overseeing the park and the
  square in front of the station. &lt;Grandpa&apos;s friend&gt;&apos;s car
  is there, surrounded by police cruisers with flashing lights and open
  doors.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What do we do now?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well I&apos;m sure as fuck not staying around
  to see what they&apos;re up to down there.</span> Jack says while
  accelerating again. <span class="quote speech">I hope you&apos;re okay
  with coming with me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They pass a couple more stations before the train runs over a switch and
  gets suddenly jolted to the left. It rocks side to side for a moment.
  They are now heading straight for the outer wall of the dome.
  The airlock, now in view, is rapidly coming closer. The inner
  <span class="quote non-speech">B33FY-AF</span> door is wide open.
  Technicians and police are standing around it in small groups, trying
  to figure out how and why it had opened. The ramps connecting the streets
  below to the airlock are full of parked transporters and police cars.
  Some are even on the tracks but the one Annie and Jack are approaching
  on is mostly clear. He sounds the horn.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Hold on to something!</span> Jack slams on the
  brakes. The train loses power and rumbles over a bunch of switches. The
  headlights flicker and turn off. A police car that was parked too close
  to their track gets flung aside. A bunch of technicians jump out of the
  way as the train passes them and rolls into the airlock where it comes
  to a screeching halt. Jack presses some buttons on the control panel.
</p>
<p>
  The screams of the police and technicians are drowned out by the hissing
  of pressurized air and the <i>ka-chonk</i> of large machinery.
  <span class="quote speech">Access authorized, cycling airlock, please
  stand by</span>, announces an automated voice. The bunker door behind
  them starts to move with a creaking noise. The
  <span class="quote non-speech">keepers of order</span> that had started
  to run into the airlock after the train stop and look around in
  confusion. Everything around them turns to black. The only thing Annie
  sees are the illuminated gauges on the control panel. More hissing of
  pressurized air.
</p>
<p>
  The train shakes slightly as it makes a noise that sounds like a
  mechanical version of someone clearing their throat. The gauges on the
  control panel flicker. Annie is surprised by this, the noise is
  unfamiliar to her. It turns into a constant rumbling hum and the
  headlights come on again. The bunker door ahead is moving out of the way
  revealing a long tunnel.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Everything okay? You look puzzled.</span>
  Jack looks at her.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s this weird noise?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">TODO: Change this back to say something along the
  lines of the power doesn&apos;t work outside</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The generator. The electrified tracks end
  at the air lock so the train has to generate its own power.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The police start banging on the outside of the train and yell something.
  Jack grabs a microphone off the wall and speaks into it:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gentlemen, for your own safety, please step
  back from the train.</span><br />
  He pushes a lever on the control panel and the smooth hum of the motors
  joins in with the noise of the generator.
</p>
<p>
  Jack sets the train in motion again.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">In a few minutes, it&apos;s gonna get very
  bright.</span> he says while driving into the tunnel.
  <span class="quote speech">Close your eyes if it&apos;s too bright. It
  might take a while to get used to the sunlight.</span><br />
  The train begins to move up a slight incline. An automated announcement
  comes on:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Welcome to the combined Sentinel&nbsp;Shores
  and Ivydale regional transit zone! Please note: the last train back to
  Sunside Cove departs from Ivydale&nbsp;South at 8:15PM.
  We wish you a pleasant journey.</span>
  <!--
  Herzlich willkommen im Verkehrsverbund Sentinel Shores und Efeuthal!
  Bitte beachten Sie: Der letzte Zug zurück nach Sunside Cove fährt
  um 20:15 Uhr. Wir wünschen Ihnen eine gute Reise.
  -->
</p>
<p>
  The train leans into a curve; Annie hears the screeching of the wheels
  grinding on the rails. After a moment, a blue-ish white shimmer appears
  on the walls of the tunnel. It gets brighter and brighter. The tunnel
  straightens out again and the other end comes into view. It&apos;s much
  brighter than the light over Central Square. Annie closes her eyes but
  the light continues to get brighter. For a moment, she covers them with
  her hands as the train leaves the tunnel.
</p>
<p>
  Annie hears Jack press some buttons and the clicking of relays. The
  motors go quiet, leaving the train rolling. She tries to open her
  eyes but it&apos;s still too bright.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think you could use a pair of
  sunglasses.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sunglasses?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">They&apos;re like normal glasses but... dark
  to make bright light easier on your eyes.</span><br />
  Jack puts a pair in Annie&apos;s hands. She puts them on and cautiously
  squints outside. Lots of green, brown, and gray but before she can make
  out any details, they roll into another tunnel. The automated voice
  comes on again:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">We are now approaching Ivydale South. Your
  next connections are Metro line 7 to Ivydale Distillery from platform 5,
  HST1511 to Siren&apos;s Edge from platform 14, HST815 to Nova Metropolis
  from platform 11. This train terminates here and will continue as line 5
  to Sentinel&nbsp;Shores Sea&nbsp;Market via Ivydale&nbsp;West,
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores Central Station.</span><br />
  <!--

  S7 nach Efeuthal Brauereiviertel von Bahnsteig 5, HST1511 nach
  Siren's Edge von Bahnsteig 14, HST815 nach Nova Metropolis

  Sentinel Shores Fischermarkt über Efeuthal Westkreuz,

  -->
  After a moment, Jack says quietly:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I wonder how much of these places is
  left...</span> Raising his voice back to a normal level, he adds:
  <span class="quote speech">But for now, we&apos;ll leave the train here
  and head back to base.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Base?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The bunker, we refer to it as our base of
  operations.</span><br />
  The train rolls out of the second tunnel and they find themselves in a
  station.</p>
