<p>
  Annie looks through the window in the door as the train enters the
  station. The platform is empty except for a shady figure in a hoodie
  leaning against the wall, observing the train from under his hood. She
  looks at the clock on the station: 10:34 PM - a bit late. As soon as he
  notices her, he steps away from the wall and walks up to the train.
  <span class="comment"> Is there a more elegant way to say that he stops
  leaning on the wall? </span> The pressurized air for the doors hisses in
  the lines. Annie presses the button; the door opens.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Hey, wait...</span><br />
  The guy had made his way to the door and looks directly at her.
  It&apos;s him from behind the library counter. <br />
  <span class="speech">We&apos;re gonna take this one for a couple
  stations.</span><br />
  Annie steps aside and he gets on the train as well. <br />
  <span class="speech">My name is Lucas, nice to meet you.</span><br />
  He extends his hand as the doors close. <br />
  <span class="speech">Annie.</span><br />
  He probably knew that already, right?<br />
  <span class="speech">Sorry for being late.</span><br />
  The hum of the motors sets in and the train begins to move. <br />
  <span class="speech">Perfect timing, I&apos;d say.</span><br />
   He makes a short pause before continuing quietly:<br />
   <span class="speech">So about that interaction we had earlier today
  - I assume you want to leave the dome?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Not directly...</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Okay then disregard my question and we have never
  met.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Wait. You say there is a way out of the dome?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Well, there might be. Some friends of mine say there
  is.</span><br />
  Annie thinks about it for a moment. Before yesterday, she wasn&apos;t
  even aware that there was a world outside the dome - and now she might
  find out about a way to go there? <br />
  <span class="speech">Tell me more</span>, she replies.
</p>
<p>
  They get off at a station near the city center - a place that is never
  asleep. In contrast to the empty stations everywhere else, the stations
  here are busy with people seeking entertainment, clubs, or the many bars.
  Lucas hurries down the stairs; Annie follows him.
</p>
<p>
  The streets are alive with people, seeminly few of them purposefully
  moving in a specific direction; most of them are just meandering from
  bar to bar. The street they are walking down is illuminated by strings
  of lights hanging from the buildings and between street lights. The
  muffled bass of techno coming from one of the buildings is in the air.
  She enjoys the atmosphere, she hadn&apos;t been here in a little while.
</p>
<p>
  Lucas turns left and enters one of the bars, Annie still following him.
  They make their way through the crowded bar towards the counter. The air
  feels dense and depleted, and carries the smell of alcohol. Live
  musicians are playing <span class="comment"> Idk? Music genre? Need ideas
  </span> on a small stage area in the corner. <br />
  <span class="speech">Hey Kate, I&apos;ll take a <span class="comment">
  some very alcoholic drink? &quot;Braincell Rattler&quot;? Idk </span>
  and my uhh... friend here looks like she needs a coffee.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Okay. Going to the back room?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Yeah.</span><br />
  Coffee sounds good... The back room? Annie raises an eyebrow. He opens a
  door next to the counter and gestures her to follow.
</p>
<p>
  Lucas takes off his hoodie and hangs it on a hook on the wall. Annie does
  the same with her jacket. She looks into the room: A bunch of people
  sitting around a large, round table - to her surprise including her
  grandpa. <br />
  <span class="speech">Grandpa Karl?</span> <span class="comment">Language
  intuition question: Is this how one would realistically refer to their
  grandpa?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Hi Annie!</span> <span class="comment">TODO: Fix
  this</span><br />
  Before she has time to voice her confusion, they get interrupted: <br />
  <span class="speech">Here you go, your drinks. Enjoy!</span><br />
  Lucas walks up to the window that connects to behind the counter. <br />
  <span class="speech">Thank you!</span><br />
  Annie takes a second to regain her composure. <span class="comment">
  I don&apos;t think this is a great way to say that, Idk. </span>
  <span class="speech">Thanks.</speech>
</p>
<p>
  They sit down at the table. Karl starts introducing people and some
  introduce themselves. Then, he continues talking about the group&apos;s
  mission:
</p>
<p class="speech">
  <span class="comment">TODO: whole paragraph speech formatting</span>
  <span class="speech">We are working on getting the city officials to
  change their stance on some things. When the city was built, it was seen
  as sort of a plan B for humanity in case things would get worse.
  It wasn&apos;t built as a place where we could go and hide forever in
  isolation. Over time, knowledge of the outside world stopped being an
  imagination of a possible bright future, and instead it became something
  to be worried about. &#8216;What do you mean, you want to go there?
  Do you really want to go where the air you breathe is literal poison
  and die?&apos;</span>
</p>
<p class="speech">
  <span class="comment">TODO: whole paragraph speech formatting</span>
  <span class="speech">My dad used to always say - and maybe this was naive
  hope on his part - that it would get better one day and that we could
  open up the airlocks and leave. That was many, many years ago. It&apos;s
  been over a century now since the city was sealed - even if it was naive
  hope on his part, we should at least take a look outside and see for
  ourselves what it&apos;s like.</span><br />
  Voices of agreement all around the table. <span class="comment">move
  this outside of the speech paragraph</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="comment">
    missing: more dialog to tie this together
  </li>
  <li class="comment">
    Important information: The door Jack wants to open is of the same type
    as the doors used for the airlocks.
  </li>
  <li class="comment">
    The whole Jack topic needs to be brought up in general. They could talk
    about how having someone outside might be useful.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span class="speech">I mean we have that manual at the library.</span>
  says Lucas. <span class="speech">It&apos;s just classified because they
  really don&apos;t want anyone to open or use the air locks.</span><br />
  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key chain.<br />
  <span class="speech">If you want, you can try getting it - I can&apos;t
  because I disappeared from a birthday party with an excuse and they are
  probably waiting for me to be back.</span><br />
  He places the keys in the center of the table.<br />
  Karl says: <span class="speech">I would love to, but I&apos;m afraid I
  can&apos;t run if things go south.</span><br />
  A bunch of other excuses from other people. Finally, Annie takes the
  initiative:<br />
  <span class="speech">I could go. Anyone want to help me with this?</span>
