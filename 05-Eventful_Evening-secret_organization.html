<h1> Eventful Evening</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->
<p>
  Annie looks through the window in the door as the train enters the
  station. The platform is empty except for a shady figure in a hoodie
  leaning against the wall, observing the train from under his hood. She
  looks at the clock in the station: 10:34 PM - a bit late. As soon as he
  notices her, he starts walking up to the train. The pressurized air for
  the doors hisses in the lines. Annie presses the button; the door opens.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Hey, wait...</span><br />
  He had made his way to the door and looks directly at her. It&apos;s the
  guy from behind the library counter. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re gonna take this one for a couple
  stations.</span><br />
  Annie steps aside and he gets on. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m Lucas, nice to meet you.</span> He
  extends his hand.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie.</span> He probably knew that already,
  right?<br />
  The door chime sounds and the doors close.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sorry for being late.</span><br />
  The hum of the motors sets in and the train begins to move.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Perfect timing, I&apos;d say. We were gonna
  take this one anyway.</span><br />
  He makes a short pause before continuing quietly:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So about that interaction we had earlier today
  &ndash; I assume you want to leave the dome?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not directly...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay then disregard my question and we have
  never met.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wait. You say there is a way out of the
  dome?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, there might be. Some friends of mine say
  there is.</span><br />
  Annie thinks about it for a moment. Before yesterday, she wasn&apos;t
  even aware that life could exist outside the dome - and now she might
  find out about a way to go there? <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Tell me more</span>, she replies.
</p>
<p>
  They get off at a station near the city center - a place that is never
  asleep. In contrast to the empty stations everywhere else, the stations
  here are busy with people seeking entertainment, clubs, or the many bars.
  Lucas hurries down the stairs; Annie follows him.
</p>
<p>
  The streets are alive with people, seeminly few of them purposefully
  moving in a specific direction; most are just meandering from bar to
  bar. The street they are walking down is illuminated by strings of lights
  hanging from the buildings and between street lights. The muffled bass of
  techno is in the air. She enjoys the atmosphere, she hadn&apos;t been
  here in a little while.
</p>
<p>
  Lucas suddenly turns left and enters one of the bars. Annie follows.
  The air feels dense and depleted, and carries the smell of alcohol. A guy
  is playing ragtime on a piano in the corner. They make their way through
  the crowded room towards the counter.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hey Kate, I&apos;ll take a Braincell Rattler
  and my uhh... friend here looks like she needs a coffee.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay. Going to the back room?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yeah.</span><br />
  Coffee sounds good... The back room? Annie raises an eyebrow. He opens a
  door next to the counter and gestures her to follow.
</p>
<p>
  Lucas takes off his hoodie and hangs it on a hook on the wall. Annie does
  the same with her jacket. She looks into the room: A bunch of people
  sitting around a large, round table - to her surprise including her
  grandpa.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">You here? ...</span><br />
  Before she has time to further voice her confusion, Kate sets their
  drinks on a small table in front of the window connecting to behind the
  counter.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Here you go, enjoy!</span><br />
  Lucas walks up to it. <span class="quote speech">Thank you!</span><br />
  Annie takes a moment to process the situation.
  <span class="comment">Is there a better way to say this?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Thanks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  A woman addresses her grandpa: <span class="quote speech">Karl, you two
  seem to know each other?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">My granddaughter Annie &ndash; good that
  you&apos;re here, we were about to discuss the call we had
  yesterday.</span><br />
  He introduces Annie and the othe group members and everyone sits down
  at the table. Then, addressing Annie, he begins to speak:
</p>
<p class="quote speech">
  <span class="comment">TODO: whole paragraph speech formatting</span>
  <span class="quote speech">I guess I owe you an explanation.
  We are working on opening up the gates connecting Sunside&nbsp;Cove to
  the outside world. When the city was built, it was seen as sort of a
  temporary plan B for humanity in case things would get worse, not as
  a hiding space for all eternity. Over time though, knowledge of what
  happened outside turned into fear and a bunch of <i>what if</i>s, and
  any attempt to talk sense into city officials fell on deaf ears.</span>
</p>
<p class="quote speech">
  <span class="comment">TODO: whole paragraph speech formatting</span>
  <span class="quote speech">My dad used to always say - and maybe this
  was naive hope on his part - that it would get better one day and that
  we could open up the airlocks and leave. That was many, many years ago.
  It&apos;s been over a century now since the city was sealed - even if it
  was naive hope on his part, we should at least take a look outside and
  see for ourselves what it&apos;s like.</span><br />
  Voices of agreement all around the table. <span class="comment">move
  this outside of the speech paragraph</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="comment">
    missing: more dialog to tie this together
  </li>
  <li class="comment">
    Important information: The door Jack wants to open is of similar type
    as the doors used for the airlocks.
  </li>
  <li class="comment">
    The whole Jack topic needs to be brought up in general. They could talk
    about how having someone outside might be useful.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I mean we have that manual at the
  library.</span>
  says Lucas. <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s just classified because
  they really don&apos;t want anyone to open or use the air locks.</span>
  <br />
  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key chain.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">If you want, you can try getting it - I
  can&apos;t because I disappeared from a birthday party with an excuse
  and they&apos;re waiting for me to be back.</span><br />
  He places the keys in the center of the table.<br />
  Karl says: <span class="quote speech">I would love to, but I&apos;m
  afraid I can&apos;t run if things go south.</span><br />
  A bunch of other excuses from other people. Finally, Annie takes the
  initiative:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I could go. Anyone want to help me with
  this?</span>
