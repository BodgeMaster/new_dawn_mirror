  Annie rings the doorbell and waits. Nobody answers. She checks that
  she&apos;s at the right door &ndash; yes, this is grandpa Karl&apos;s
  place. She rings again. A window on <span class="comment">in?</span>
  one of the adjacent buildings opens and she hears Isabelle quietly
  calling her name.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, we&apos;re over here.</span><br />
  Annie beings to walk over.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Which door?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Number 15, I&apos;ll let you in.</span><br />
</p>
<p>

  They go to the living room where cables and opened boxes of computer
  parts are all over the floor. Lucas sits on the floor in front of
  the rack. The side panels had been removed, revealing the rails holding
  the various devices inside as well as their power cables. One of the
  devices, a large metal box with many boards inside, is hanging
  half-disassembled out the front.
