<h1>RTFM</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->

<p>
  Annie rings the doorbell and waits. Nobody answers. She checks that
  she&apos;s at the right door &ndash; yes, this is grandpa Karl&apos;s
  apartment. She rings again. A window on <span class="comment">in?</span>
  one of the adjacent houses opens and she hears Isabelle quietly
  calling her.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, we&apos;re over here.</span><br />
  She walks over.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Which door?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Number 15, I&apos;ll let you in.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
  The others are inside.
  <br />
  Karl says: <span class="quote speech">We needed a little more space.
  This place has been <span class="comment">vacant</span> forever, might
  as well use it.</span><br />
  Annie slides her shoes off and leans her bag against the wall. Then,
  they go to the living room where cables and computer parts are all over
  the floor. Lucas sits in front of the rack between two opened boxes.
  The rack&apos;s side panels had been removed, revealing the rails holding
  the various devices inside and their power cables. Lucas is pushing
  a circuit board into a half-assembled device that hangs out the front.
  Karl goes over to a stool next to the rack, carefully avoiding stepping
  on things, and sits down.
</p>
<p>
  Annie sits down next to Lucas and watches as he carefully inserts one
  board after the other. Karl is looking at the manual and tells him
  to set some tiny switches on the front of some of them.<br />
  <!-- four thick ribbon cables need to be added to connect the backs of
  the backplanes -->
