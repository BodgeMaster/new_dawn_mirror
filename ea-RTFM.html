<h1>RTFM</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->

<p>
  Annie arrives at a house with multiple ground-level entrances.
  She rings one of the doorbells and waits. Nobody answers. She checks
  that it is the right door &ndash; yes, this is grandpa Karl&apos;s
  apartment. She rings again. A window on <span class="comment">in?</span>
  one of the adjacent houses opens and she hears Isabelle quietly calling
  her:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, we&apos;re over here.</span><br />
  She walks over.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Which door?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Number 15, I&apos;ll let you in.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
  Lucas and Karl are also inside.
  <br />
  Karl says: <span class="quote speech">We needed a little more space.
  This place has been <span class="comment">vacant</span> forever, might
  as well use it.</span><br />
  Annie slides her shoes off and leans her bag against the wall. Then,
  they go into the living room where cables and computer parts are all over
  the floor. Lucas sits in front of the rack between two opened boxes.
  The rack&apos;s side panels had been removed, revealing the devices
  mounted inside and the cables connecting them. Lucas is pushing a circuit
  board into a half-assembled metal box that hangs out the front. Karl goes
  over to a stool next to the rack, carefully avoiding stepping on things,
  and sits down.
</p>
<p>
  Annie sits down next to Lucas and watches as he carefully
  <span class="comment">synonym for careful?</span> inserts another
  board. Karl is reading from a binder of documentation and tells him to
  set some tiny switches on its front edge.<br />
  While grabbing the next board, Lucas says:
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, can you take these and prepare the DIP
  switches?</span><br />
  He pushes the box over to her. It contains four circuit boards, all
  identical.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhm, okay.</span>
  She takes one of the boards out and looks at it. It&apos;s full of
  electronic components on both sides and one of the edges holds a tiny red
  box with an even tinier row of switches on it.<br />
  <span class="comment">Above is a bad description. Need naive description
  of DIP switches from someone who doesn&apos;t know.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So what do I set them to?</span><br />
  Karl tells her a combination and she tries to push the switches up or
  down as needed with her finger nails.<br />
  Lucas says <span class="quote speech">Here, use this.</span> and hands
  her a pen.<br />
  Using it to flip the switches, she sets the combination Karl says, then
  hands the board over to Lucas and grabs the next one.
</p>
<p>
  Karl takes the racks&apos;s power cable and plugs it in. Isabelle gets
  the terminal from a corner of the room and lifts it onto the rack.
  Meanwhile, Annie and Lucas start collecting the cables and loose parts
  from the floor. Isabelle plugs the terminal into power and Karl connects
  a cable between it and one of the devices in the front of the rack.
  They all gather around and Karl powers it on. He follows the same
  procedure that Annie and Isabelle performed in the library: Key switch
  at the top of the rack to <span class="quote non-speech">RST</span>,
  power up the hard drive, hold <span class="quote non-speech">LOAD</span>
  and key switch to <span class="quote non-speech">RUN</span>. Then, he
  pulls a floppy disk out of the documentation binder and inserts it into
  the computer. He enters some commands, the drive clicks a few times, and
  the terminal displays a menu.
