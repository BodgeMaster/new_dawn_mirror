<h1> Open Up! </h1>
<!-- perspective: Jack -->
<p class="comment">
  This is probably a working title until I come up with something better.
  Just thought it was funny. Too similar to &quot;Wake up!&quot; tho.
</p>

<p>
  Jack puts the soldering iron back into its holder and admires his
  creation. This hack job of bodge wires and not quite right replacement
  components, held together by what remains of the corroded motor driver
  board is truly beautiful in the ugliest way possible &ndash; in his eyes
  at least. He picks it up and ispects the other side.<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Probably good enough.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">A note on the spelling of &quot;bodge&quot;:
  You may or may not have noticed that I tend to stick to American English.
  This is a notable exception. There is no mistake here. The word
  &quot;bodge&quot; looks way more elegant spelled this way. I&apos;m the
  BodgeMaster &ndash; BotchMaster would look weird, wouldn&apos;t it?
  If you think I&apos;m wrong, then you&apos;re wrong. :)</span>

  Jack gets up and walks over to the bunker door. He mounts the board to
  the motor &ndash; using only two of the screws &ndash; and begins
  connecting the wires. The moment the power cable comes into contact with
  the board, the motor starts making a harsh buzzing sound. He drops the
  cable and it stops.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So that&apos;s why this was burnt out.</span>
  <br />
  He fetches a multimeter and pokes around the board and the mess of wires.
  One of the control wires is stuck on.
</p>
<p>
  After a bit of fiddling with the electronics under the door controls,
  he gives up and removes all the control wires. Then, he bolts the cables
  for power and ground to their lugs and connects another wire to the power
  cable. He touches it to one of the contacts. There&apos;s that buzzing
  again. He touches it to the next one, The motor starts spinning and the
  bunker door begins to move. It squeaks and scratches as it slowly
  retracts into the ceiling.

  Lay of the land from a neutral perspective:<br />
  The bunker sits about a third up the side of a small valley with
  a small river flowing in the middle. The bunker door faces north, down
  into the valley. The valley opens up and gets larger to the west and
  gets narrower/smaller and ends to the south-east.
  In front of the bunker is a small flat area that is overgrown with
  bushes. The flat area connects to a road coming from around the
  mountain to the south-west and going a bit past the bunker to the east,
  where it then takes a turn and crosses over a bridge to the other side.
  From there, it follows the valley back to the west and disappears
  around a mountain to the north-west.
  In the next valley over to the north is the city of Ivydale.
  The land gets flatter from there to the north-west, the location of
  Ivydale's larger sister city Sentinel Shores.

  Jack takes the wire off the contact and leaves it dangling. He steps
  forward and looks outside. The area in front of the bunker is completely
  overgrown with large bushes. He pushes the leaves aside and
