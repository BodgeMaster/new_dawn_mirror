<h1> Open Up! </h1>
<p class="comment">
  This is probably a working title until I come up with something better.
  Just thought it was funny. Too similar to &quot;Wake up!&quot; tho.

  Jack puts the soldering iron back into its holder and admires his
  creation. This hack job of bodge wires and not quite the right
  replacement components, held together by what remains of the corroded
  motor driver board is truly beautiful in the ugliest way possible &ndash;
  in his eyes at least. He picks it up and ispects the other side.
  <span class="quote non-speech">Probably good enough.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">A note on the spelling of &quot;bodge&quot;:
  You may or may not have noticed that I tend to stick to American English.
  This is a notable exception. There is no mistake here. The word
  &quot;bodge&quot; looks way more elegant spelled this way. I&apos;m the
  BodgeMaster &ndash; BotchMaster would look weird, wouldn&apos;t it?
  If you think I&apos;m wrong, then you&apos;re wrong. :)</span>

  Jack gets up and walks over to the bunker door. He mounts the board to
  the motor &ndash; using only two of the screws &ndash; and attaches the
  wires.
