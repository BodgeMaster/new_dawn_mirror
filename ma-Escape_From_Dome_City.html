<h1> Escape From Dome City</h1>
<p>
  Annie reaches the platform. The sirens of the police cars are really
  close now. A train is coming. The first police car arrives at the station.
  Annie freezes as she panics. The train for sure won&apos;t leave before
  the police searched it. Where can she hide?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Annie!</span> Someone shouts her name.
  <span class="speech">Annie, get in here, run!</span><br />
  She breaks out of her freeze. The train had turned out to be a single
  car. A single, slightly rusty railcar painted in different shades of
  blue. <span class="comment">note: make it a theme that the metro is
  always yellow and red</span> The only person inside is the driver,
  turning away from the door he just opened - that has to be Jack. His
  Neotek jacket flaps in the air as he runs to the other end of the train.
  While Annie is still running towards the open door, the motors start
  humming. She jumps inside as the train starts to move back in the
  direction it came from. The door closes just after leaving the platform.
</p>
<p>
  The train accelerates with a force stronger than anything she has ever
  felt before. The motors scream, the entire train rattles. While making
  her way to the front, she looks outside. The city flies by. The horn
  sounds as the train barrels though the next station. The platform
  appears, is visible for just long enough to see the astonished faces of
  the onlookers, and disappears again.
</p>
<p>
  She reaches the driver&apos;s cabin.<br />
  <span class="speech">Hello Jack!</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Hi Annie &ndash; you good?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Yes</span>, she breathes heavily,
  <span class="speech">but that was close.</span><br />
  After catching her breath for a moment, she says:<br />
  <span class="speech">You arrived just in time. They&apos;ve been
  following me around for a while but we got away.</span><br />
  Jack seems to think for a short moment while his eyes stay fixated on the
  track ahead.<br />
  <span class="speech">That remains to be seen. Coming through that
  airlock seems to have set off some sort of alarm. Like poking a stick
  into an anthill...</span><br />
  <span class="speech">An anthill?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Oh, I forgot, you wouldn&apos;t know... Ants are
  tiny little animals. They build hills of loose material as their nests.
  If you poke a stick into one, they scramble to defend it.</span><br />
  Annie imagines a bunch of mice scratching and biting away at a stick
  that&apos;s stuck in a slope of rubble.<br />
  <span class="speech">Anyway</span>, Jack continues,
  <span class="speech">this little expedition hasn&apos;t gone
  unnoticed.</span><br />
  Short pause.
</p>
<p>
  Looking outside again, Annie realizes:<br />
  <span class="speech">I have never seen one of these</span> &ndash; she
  knocks on the control panel &ndash; <span class="speech">go this
  fast.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Me neither</span>, says Jack. He adds:
  <span class="speech">There used to be trains that could go faster &ndash;
  a lot faster &ndash; but not the metro.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After watching the tracks, stations, and buildings fly by for a couple
  minutes, Annie opens her bag and pulls out a pile of paper.<br />
  <span class="speech">Here are the documents you need. Maps, blueprints,
  manuals, everything we could find.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Sounds good. Just put them in there for now.</span>
  <br />
  He gestures towards a small cabinet in the back of the driver&apos;s
  cabin. Annie places the pile on top of a few folders and binders that are
  already in there. The train barrels through another station. Jack slowly
  decelerates the train.<br />
  <span class="speech">We&apos;re almost at your drop-off point, next
  station is Crystal Park ... uhhh ... and we might have a problem.</span>
  <br />
  The train is going around a long curve overseeing the park and square in
  front of the station. &lt;Grandpa&apos;s friend&gt;&apos;s car is there,
  surrounded by police cruisers with flashing lights and open doors.<br />
  <span class="speech">What do we do now?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Well I&apos;m sure as fuck not staying around to
  see what they&apos;re up to down there.</span> Jack says while
  accelerating again. <span class="speech">I hope you&apos;re okay with
  coming with me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They pass a couple more stations before the train runs over a switch and
  gets suddenly jolted to the side. The train rocks side to side for a
  moment. They are now heading straight for the outer wall of the dome.
  The airlock, now in view, is rapidly coming closer. The inner
  &#8216;B33FY-AF&apos; door is wide open. Technicians and police are
  standing around it in small groups, trying to figure out why and how
  it had opened. The ramps connecting the street below to the airlock are
  full of parked transporters and police cars. Some are even on the tracks
  but the one Annie and Jack are approaching on is mostly clear.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Hold onto something!</span> Jack slams on the
  brakes. The train loses power and rumbles over a bunch of switches.
  The headlights flicker and turn off. A police car that was parked too
  close to their track gets flung aside. A bunch of technicians jump out of
  the way as the train passes them and rolls into the airlock where it
  comes to a screeching halt. Jack presses some buttons on the control
  panel.
</p>
<p>
  The screams of the police and technicians are drowned out by the hissing
  of pressurized air and the *ka-chonk* of large machinery.
  <span class="speech">Access authorized, cycling airlock, please stand
  by</span>, announces an automated voice. The bunker door behind them
  starts to move with a squeaking noise. The &#8216;keepers of order&apos;
  that had started to run after the train into the airlock stop and look
  around in confusion. Everything around them turns to black. The only
  thing Annie sees are the illuminated gauges on the control panel. More
  hissing of pressurized air.
</p>
<p>
  The train shakes slightly as it makes a noise that sounds like a
  mechanical version of someone clearing their throat. The gauges on the
  control panel flicker. Annie is surprised by this, the noise is
  unfamiliar to her. It turns into a constant rumbling hum and the
  headlights come on again. The bunker door ahead is moving out of the way
  revealing a long tunnel.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Everything okay? You look puzzled.</span> Jack looks
  at her.<br />
  <span class="speech">What&apos;s this weird noise?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">The generator. There&apos;s no power out here so
  the train itself has to generate it to drive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The police start banging on the outside of the train and yell something.
  Jack grabs a microphone off the wall and speaks into it:<br />
  <span class="speech">Gentlemen, for your own safety, please step back
  from the train.</span><br />
  He pushes a lever on the control panel and the smooth hum of the motors
  joins in with the noise of the generator.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">In a couple minutes, it&apos;s gonna get very
  bright.</span> Jack says while driving the train into the tunnel.
  <span class="speech">Close your eyes if it&apos;s too bright. It might
  take a while to get used to the sun.</span><br />
  The train begins to move up a slight incline. An automated announcement
  comes on:<br />
  <span class="speech">Dear passengers, welcome to the combined
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores and Ivydale local transit zone! Please keep in mind
  that the last train returning to &lt;underground city&gt; for today
  departs from Ivydale&nbsp;South at 10:15PM. Enjoy your travel!</span>
</p>
<p>
  The train leans into a curve; Annie hears the screeching of the wheels
  grinding on the rails. After a moment, a blue-ish white shimmer appears
  on the walls of the tunnel. It gets brighter and brighter. The tunnel
  straightens out again and the other end comes into view. It&apos;s much
  brighter than the light over Central Square. Annie closes her eyes but
  the light continues to get brighter. For a moment, she covers them with
  her hands as the train leaves the tunnel.
</p>
<p>
  Annie hears Jack press some buttons and the clicking of relays. The
  motors go quiet and the train starts to slow down. She tries to open her
  eyes but it&apos;s still too bright.<br />
  <span class="speech">I think you could use a pair of sunglasses.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Sunglasses?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">They&apos;re like normal glasses but... dark to
  make bright light easier on your eyes.</span><br />
  Jack puts a pair in Annie&apos;s hands. She puts them on and cautiously
  squints outside. Lots of green, brown, and gray but before she can make
  out any details, they roll into another tunnel. The automated voice
  comes on again:<br />
  <span class="speech">We are now approaching Ivydale South. Your next
  connections are line 7 to Ivydale Distillery from platform 5, HST1511 to
  Siren&apos;s Edge from platform 14, HST815 to Nova Metropolis from
  platform 11. This train will continue on line 5 to Sentinel&nbsp;Shores
  Sea&nbsp;Market via Ivydale&nbsp;West, Sentinel&nbsp;Shores Observatory,
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores Central Station.</span><br />
  After a moment, Jack says quietly:<br />
  <span class="speech">I wonder how much of these places is left...</span>
  Raising his voice back to a normal level, he adds:
  <span class="speech">But for now, we&apos;ll head back to base.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Base?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">The bunker, we refer to it as our base of
  operations.</span><br />
  The train rolls out of the second tunnel and they find themselves in a
  station.</p>
