<h1> &lt;Emily incoming call&gt; </h1>

<p class="comment">
  At some point before this chapter, the protagonists need to make phone
  calls happen &ndash; probably from the perspective of those on Earth as
  most of the things in the Lunar Biosphere have been at least kinda
  maintained.

  Emily finds herself still staring into the sky. She lifts her head.

  That&apos;s the phone in the control room.

  She gets up and realizes that she had been completely neglecting her
  bodily needs (food, water, ...) and that her back hurts.

  She starts makeing her way to the main control center, part-way there the
  phone stops ringing. She goes to the nearest bathroom, goes to one of the
  kitchens to grab the next vegetable she can find, and heads to the control
  center to log on at a terminal.
