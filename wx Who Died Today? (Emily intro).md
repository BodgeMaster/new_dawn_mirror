Emily wakes up. She is laying in bed, facing the large panorama window. Her eyes wander across the familiar gray moonscape outside before fixating on the half-visible Earth ball for a moment. A noise - someone is in her module.

Emily turns around to find her older sister Lena sitting against the wall with tears running down her face. After a moment to fully wake up and grasp the situation, she asks:  
"Who?"  
Lena snivels and points to the ring on her finger. *Dictionary to the rescue! Is that the right word? ...*  
A grim but not uncommon way for days to begin lately. That leaves five of them, and since Tony is gone there is no more hope for a cure.
