"Ahh fuck!" Jack exclaims in pain as he wakes up. He has a terrible headache. As he moves his hands up to hold his head, he realizes that his entire body hurts. "Owwowwowwowwoww... Ouch!"  
"Emergency defrost complete. Entering low power mode." announces an automated voice.  
He thinks to himself: "Get it together, Jack! You knew this was gonna happen. You have trained for this. Where are the meds again? ..."

Waiting for the painkillers to kick in, Jack stays in his preservation chamber until he is fully awake. As he stands there, he looks out of the small window in the door. The bunker looks different from yesterday - not yesterday! That was how ever many years ago... Besides the point. It looks different. Not just "things have moved around different", it looks almost like a lost place. Unexpected but whatever...

The pressurized air hisses in the lines as the door of the preservation chamber swings aside. Jack steps out into the bunker, breathes the musty air, and looks around. The light shining out of his chamber reveals the dirty floor. The table and chairs in front of him, as well as the kitchen across the room, are covered in dust and all exposed bits of metal have rust. The red night lights on the ceiling are dimly illuminating the rest of the bunker. He looks to the left: The wall is lined with other preservation chambers, all except one of them being powered down. In front of the back wall are desks holding a radio, a terminal, and some *need useful object here*. To the left of the desks in the corner is a minicomputer in a half-height rack and a teleprinter, and above it a phone on the wall - the usual Neotek equipment. He looks to the right: More preservation chambers. Instead of a wall, there’s the bunker door - door is a bit of an understatement, it’s a massive gate. A small slither of light passes under it. "These fucking idiots... They didn’t reseal it properly."

He walks over to the door’s control panel. The paint is flaking off revealing the rust underneath. Jack attempts to press a couple buttons but they get stuck and nothing happens. "Fuck." He turns back to the inside of the bunker looking for tools, contemplating the tradeoff between waking up a couple years too soon and getting slowly poisoned by the air, and being locked inside a bunker due to a bunch of apparent troglodytes who are unable to close a door properly... Doesn’t matter, too late now.

As he passes each of the presevation chambers, he looks into them. Empty, empty, empty - nothing unexpected here. His own chamber... He presses a few buttons to fully shut it down. The lamp in the ceiling turns off, the door closes, the status lights turn off. After passing two other empty preservaton chambers, he reaches the one that remains active.  
"Hello Michelle." He checks the status lights of her chamber. "I think I’m gonna leave you in there for now. Should be fine..."  
He continues past the remaining empty chambers to the back of the bunker.

The phone lifts off the wall with a quiet click and Jack begins to dial. He holds the receiver to his ear - silence. Welp, another thing that isn’t working. He puts it back on the wall while turning to the terminal.

Bonk! At least this seems to work. While waiting for the picture tube to warm up, he opens the lid on the teleprinter - only to find that something has eaten most of the paper. He removes what remains and opens one of the cabinets under the desks. By some miracle, the animal that ate the paper on the printer didn’t find the rest. He takes a piece of the stack and tears it off. Then, he sets it on top of the desk with a thump. *need translation for "Staub aufwirbeln"*

The terminal screen reaches full brightness as Jack feeds the paper into the printer. He makes sure the holes on the feed ribbons line up with the mechanism, then he turns back to the terminal and begins to type.
