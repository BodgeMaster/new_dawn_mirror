  Emily wakes up. She is laying in bed, facing the large panorama window.
  Her eyes wander across the familiar gray moonscape outside before
  fixating on the half-visible Earth ball for a moment. A noise - someone
  is in her module.
</p>
<p>
  She turns around to find her older sister Lena sitting against the
  wall - tears running down her face. After a moment to fully wake up and
  grasp the situation, Emily asks:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Who?</span><br />
  Lena snivels and points to the ring on her finger. <span class="comment">
  Dictionary to the rescue! Is that the right word? ... </span>
  A grim but not uncommon way for days to begin lately. That leaves five
  of them, and since Tony is gone there is no more hope for a cure.

  The air hisses in the lines as the door closes behind them. The noise of
  the vacuum pumps kicks in and begins to slowly fade.<br />
  <span class="comment">They carry a coffin made of thin aluminum plates
  outside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="comment">What is the moon&apos;s surface made of?
  Solid regalith or sand? Can it be shoveled?</span><br />
  They place the coffin on the ground and start digging away at its sides,
  slowly sinking it into the ground.
