The station is is much larger than any of the metro stations inside the dome. It has many platforms. Portions of the tall roof that is supported by long pillars have caved in and what’s still standing has holes. Rays of light poke through holes in the wall ahead, and some of the holes in the roof, landing on the wall to the left. All of that is visually stunning but what really catches Annie’s eyes are the plants everywhere. Parts of the platforms are densely covered in the thin, green blades of some plant giving them a fuzzy look. Unfamiliar vines cling to the walls and pillars, crawl along gaps and edges, and hang from rusty beams and the fringes of the caved in roof sections. Moss grows on the rusted benches and trash cans.

After running over a bunch of bushes and tall flowers that have taken root on the tracks, Jack brings the train to a stop close to the end of the platform.  
"Exit to the right in the direction of travel", he says in unison with the automated voice before turning the switch for the doors. They open with a squeaking sound.  
"After you." He nods towards the passenger area.

*TODO: Fix this up:*

Jack and Annie step out onto the platform. Annie breathes the warm air. It smells of plants. Insects are buzzing about, and the wind rustles through the leaves.
