                    Emily doesn&apos;t (yet) want to leave the moon -
                    she&apos;s afraid of leaving her entire world behind
                  </li>
                  <li class="comment">
                    The decision is made that whatever preparations can be
                    done, should be done, just in case
                  </li>
                </ul>

  Emily closes the cage and puts the <span class="comment">whatever they
  feed the mice</span> back into the cupboard. She double-checks that the
  cage is really closed, then she steps out into the hallway, and starts
  walking. The entire habitat is eerily quiet. Apart from her own
  footsteps, she hears just the hum of the electrical systems and the
  quiet whirr of the air circulation.
</p>
<p>
  3 &ndash; 5 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 1 &ndash; Enter. The keypad beeps with
  every button press. A computer voice announces
  <span class="quote speech">Access authorized</span> and the door slides
  up. She steps through into the main control center. The module contains
  one large room with rows of integrated computer equipment desks arranged
  in a <span class="comment">Mondsichel</span> shape with the
  <span class="comment">W&ouml;lbung</span> to the left. Most of the seats
  are facing that way, allowing a view of the biotope through a huge
  panorama window taking up the entire wall. The biotope is an even larger
  module with a ceiling of glass and support beams, completely filled with
  plant life, trees, small critters, and a big pond. The walls across from
  her and to the right hold large status panels with some seven-segment
  displays for information and lots of big status indicator symbols.
</p>
<p>
  Emily walks down the shallow stairs towards the panorama window. In
  front of the window are tables and chairs that were moved there recently
  as the room had become more of a general hangout spot for the remaining
  people. Now, it&apos;s just Lena and her.
</p>
<p>
  Lena sits at one of the tables, cutting a piece of bread into slices.
  In front of her is a bowl with fruit and a honey jar.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing dialog about food and starting to eat
</p>
<p>
  They get interrupted by all of the equipment in the room suddenly coming
  alive. All of the computer desks that weren&apos;t perviously active
  turn on. Some of the status indicators on the back wall start blinking.
  A large, green triangle with the letters LINK next to it flickers and
  then lights up. Emily looks at it in confusion.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s going on?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s them.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Earth people?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes</span>, Lena replies while quickly
  finishing her meal, <span class="quote speech">They have some abilities
  to remotely control things &ndash; including turning on the main radio
  transmitter.</span><br />
  She gets up and asks Emily to follow her to one of the consoles with a
  terminal. She sits down in front of it, logs on and enters a few
  commands.
