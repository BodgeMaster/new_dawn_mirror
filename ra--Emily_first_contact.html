    Emily walks to the main control center

        it has also been used as a general hang-out spot bc it has a rather

    Emily and Lena sit down at a desk with a view of the biotope and have
    a meal
    <ul>
      <li class="comment">
        the meal gets interrupted by the equipment in the control center
        coming to life (fans coming on, some control panels lighting up,
        boot-up/status/ready beeps)
        <ul>
          <li class="comment">
            a status light on the wall, that Emily had never seen on,
            lights up (could be something like &quot;LINK&quot;)
          </lI>
          <li class="comment">
            short dialog, could be something like this: &quot;That&apos;s
            them.&quot; &quot;Earth people?&quot; Lena nods and gets up.

                    Emily doesn&apos;t (yet) want to leave the moon -
                    she&apos;s afraid of leaving her entire world behind
                  </li>
                  <li class="comment">
                    The decision is made that whatever preparations can be
                    done, should be done, just in case
                  </li>
                </ul>

<p>
  <span class="comment">note: need to check mice eating behavior when fed,
  might want to add a section where she actually handles and feeds them
  </span><br />
  Emily closes the cage and puts the &lt;whatever they feed the mice&gt;
  back into the cupboard. She <span class="comment">does something related
  to taking care of the mice</span>, steps out into the hallway, and
  starts walking. The entire habitat is eerily quiet. Apart from her steps,
  just the hum of the electrical systems and the quiet whirr of the air
  circulation are audible.
</p>
<p>
  3 &ndash; 5 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 1 &ndash; Enter. The keypad beeps with
  every button press. A computer voice announces
  <span class="speech">Access authorized</span>. The door to the main
  control center module slides up and she steps through. The module
  contains one large room with rows of integrated computer equipment desks
  arranged <span class="comment">need a fitting description of what a
  mission control rom looks like</span>. The wall to the left that most of
  the seats are facing is completely taken up by a panorama window into
  the biosphere, an even larger module with a ceiling of glass and support
  beams completely taken up by plant life, trees, small animals, and a big
  pond. The wall to the right holds a large status panel with some
  seven-segment displays for information and lots of big status indicator
  symbols.
</p>
<p>
  Emily walks down the shallow stairs towards the panorama window. In
  front of the window are tables and chairs that were moved there recently
  as the room had become more of a general hangout spot for the remaining
  people when they were still around. Lena sits at one of them,
  <span class="comment">preparing something</span> while waiting for her.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing dialog about food and starting to eat
</p>
<p>
  They get interrupted by all of the equipment in the room suddenly coming
  alive. All of the computer desks that weren&apos;t perviously active
  turn on. Some of the status indicators on the back wall start blinking.
  A large, green triangle with the letters LINK next to it flickers and
  then lights up. Emily looks at it in confusion.<br />
  <span class="speech">What does that light mean?</span> She gestures
  towards it.<br />
  <span class="speech">That&apos;s them.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Earth people?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Yes</span>, Lena replies while quickly finishing
  her meal, <span class="speech">they said they&apos;d try to get a phone
  connection going.</span><br />
  As if on cue, the phone on the large center console begins to ring. Lena
  gets up and walks over, Emily follows her. <span class="comment">note:
  might need to imply that Lena is very sick</span> Lena sits down in
  front of it, picks up the receiver, and presses a few buttons.
  The speaker on the console starts crackling and hissing. Through the
  noise, they hear a faint voice. Lena leans over to a microphone and
  talks into it:<br />
  <span class="speech">We can&apos;t hear you, one moment.</span><br />
  She flips some switches on the console. The speaker cracles some more,
  then a loud pop, then silence. The smell of magic smoke is in the air.
</p>
<p>
  Lena turns to a terminal and starts typing.<br />
  <span class="comment">note to self: missing establishing connection<br />
  note to self: add some data corruption</span>
</p>
<pre class="terminal">
MOON-01 &gt; This hasn&apos;t been maintained in forever. I think the
          phone just went.
EARTH-53&gt; You may wanna check the modules under P2 for burnt components.
MOON-01 &gt; I know.
MOON-01 &gt; We have another problem somewhere along the line. There&apos;s
          apparently more noise than signal.
</pre>
<p>
  Lena opens a cover with a small label &quot;P2&quot; and pulls two cards
  out of their sockets and inspects them. One has a big black burn mark
  right in the center.<br />
  <span class="speech">Emily, can you fetch me this module from another
  phone?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">And?</span> Michelle asks Jack as he looks up from
  the terminal.<br />
  <span class="speech">Weak signal - and they need to fix their
  phone.</span><br />
  James asks <span class="speech">What about that plan B of increasing the
  transmit power?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Meh.</span> Jack doesn&apos;t seem too enthusiastic
  about it.<br />
  <span class="comment">TODO: Dialog. They decide not to increase the
  power before double-checking that everything is aligned properly. Sure
  enough, they&apos;re off by a bit.<br />
  Request for comment: Does this make the story more interesting or is it
  confusing? I originally didn&apos;t want to do perspective changes
  within chapters, and I still might not, but this was too good of an idea
  not to write it down.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  note to self: After fixing the alignment, pick up on the moon and
  continue.
