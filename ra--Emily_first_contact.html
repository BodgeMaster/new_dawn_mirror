                    Emily doesn&apos;t (yet) want to leave the moon -
                    she&apos;s afraid of leaving her entire world behind
                  </li>
                  <li class="comment">
                    The decision is made that whatever preparations can be
                    done, should be done, just in case
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

  Emily closes the cage and puts the &lt;whatever they feed the mice&gt;
  back into the cupboard. She <span class="comment">does something related
  to taking care of the mice</span>, steps out into the hallway, and
  starts walking. The entire habitat is eerily quiet. Apart from her steps,
  just the hum of the electrical systems and the quiet whirr of the air
  circulation are audible.
</p>
<p>
  3 &ndash; 5 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 1 &ndash; Enter. The keypad beeps with
  every button press. A computer voice announces
  <span class="quote speech">Access authorized</span> and the door slides
  up. She steps through into the main control center. The module contains
  one large room with rows of integrated computer equipment desks arranged
  <span class="comment">need a fitting description of what a mission
  control rom looks like</span>. The wall to the left that most of the
  seats are facing is completely taken up by a panorama window into the
  biotope, an even larger module with a ceiling of glass and support beams,
  completely filled with plant life, trees, small animals, and a big pond.
  The wall to the right holds a large status panel with some seven-segment
  displays for information and lots of big status indicator symbols.
</p>
<p>
  Emily walks down the shallow stairs towards the panorama window. In
  front of the window are tables and chairs that were moved there recently
  as the room had become more of a general hangout spot for the remaining
  people when there still more than just Lena and her. Lena sits at one of
  them, cutting a bread into slices while waiting for her.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing dialog about food and starting to eat
</p>
<p>
  They get interrupted by all of the equipment in the room suddenly coming
  alive. All of the computer desks that weren&apos;t perviously active
  turn on. Some of the status indicators on the back wall start blinking.
  A large, green triangle with the letters LINK next to it flickers and
  then lights up. Emily looks at it in confusion.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s going on?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s them.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Earth people?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes</span>, Lena replies while quickly
  finishing her meal, <span class="quote speech">They have some abilities
  to remotely control things &ndash; including turning on the main radio
  transmitter.</span><br />
  She gets up and asks Emily to follow her to one of the consoles with a
  terminal. She sits down in front of it, logs on and enters a few
  commands.
