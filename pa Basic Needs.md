*Annie and Jack are in a village outside of Ivydale / Sentinel Shores looking to buy food. She enters what looks like a store and sees Jack talk to a guy in his 50s or early 60s behind the counter.*

"I mean in the long run. We have plenty of food right now but, with the ongoing drought, I’m not sure that we’ll have enough to last us over the winter."  
"So, basically, you’re saying you need water."  
"Listen, the amount of water we need can’t just simply be carried here. Under normal circumstances, water flows into our irrigation system upstream and gets distributed to all the greenhouses. But with the river gone, you would need to carry *<reasonable metaphor?>* of water here every day."  
"I’m not planning on carrying it here. We can drive it here by the truckload. Will you give us food if we supply you with the water?"  
He looks askance at Jack.  
"And where do you wanna get it from?"  
"<name> Power Station."  
"Where’s that?"  
"<direction> of Ivydale."  
"And how you wanna get it here?"  
"As I said, with a truck."  
Seeing the farmer’s confusion, Jack adds: "Let that be my problem to solve. Will you trade water for food?"  
"I’m gonna have to discuss that with the others. Wait outside."
