<h1> Overdue Maintenance </h1>
<p>
  Jack parks the truck just before the exit of a tunnel and the four get
  out. Roaring water echoes from somewhere in the distance. Annie grabs
  her bag and follows the others towards the end of the tunnel. The wall
  to the right features doors, large gates, and a few windows that allow
  a peek into abandoned offices, storage spaces, and a small machine shop.
  The end of the tunnel connects to a large balcony extending into
  a narrow ravine with rusted metal walkways going to the left and right.
</p>
<p>
  They walk onto the balcony and take a look around: The walkway to the
  left goes to a freestanding staircase tower that goes down to the bottom
  of the ravine and is just as rusty as the walkway itself. The walkway
  to the right connects to the top of a concrete dam blocking the ravine.
  A couple bushes, flowers, and a small tree grow there, partially hiding
  rusty cranks and levers, and the dam is green from moss and small ferns
  growing all over its side. Water flows over the spillway, falling into
  the depths below. To the right of the dam, inset into the same rock face
  as the tunnel exit, is a wall with a window front.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, check this out!</span><br />
  Jack gestures for her to come to the railing. She hesitates.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That railing is gonna hold, yeah?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Idunno?...</span> He attempts to push
  <span class="comment">shove?</span> it and bangs agains it &ndash;
  it doesn&apos;t budge. <span class="quote speech">Probably?</span><br />
  She walks over and cautiously leans on it to peer down. The water
  flowing over the spillway joins a torrent of water rushing out of
  two big pipes deep below, at the bottom of the ravine.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle and James go ahead, using the walkway towards the dam.
  About half-way, as Michelle walks onto the next section of walkway,
  it starts making scary <span class="comment">foreboding?</span> creaking
  noises. The moment James reaches it, the creaking turns into cracking
  and the panel of <span class="comment">grid floor</span> beings
  to give out underneath his feet. He grabs on to one of the railings and
  quickly <span class="comment">hops? Idk some word between &quot;step&quot;
  and &quot;jump&quot;</span> onto the beam holding it, leaving the
  section of floor barely hanging on.<br />
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">You okay?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yeah &ndash; can&apos;t say the same for
  the floor...</span><br />
  The two walk the rest of the way across, meanwhile Annie and Jack stay
  on the balcony.
</p>
<p class="comment">TODO: Change this so Michelle and James explore the
dam first, then turn their attention to the windows.</p>
<p>
  After the <span class="comment">Aufregung?</span> dies down, Michelle
  and James start looking around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Would you look at that!</span><br />
  Michelle is looking through the windows. A few of them have cracks but
  most are somehow intact.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think I found what we&apos;re looking
  for.</span><br />
  Jack asks: <span class="quote speech">The control room?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yea, it&apos;s right here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Guess we&apos;re gonna have to climb
  across...</span><br />
  Annie says: <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m not doing that.</span>
  <br />
  James walks up to one of the windows saying:
  <span class="quote speech">Looks like there might be a way back to
  the tunnel from inside. We could let you in that way.</span><br />
  Jack replies: <span class="quote speech">That would work
  but we probably really don&apos;t wanna break these windows.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nobody said anything about breaking
  them...</span><br />
  James takes a screwdriver out of his pocket and jams it inbetween
  the window and its frame, then he quickly pulls on it. The window jumps
  open with a bang.<br />
  Michelle looks at him a bit <span class="comment">befuddled?</span>.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">What?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You seem to have some <i>interesting</i>
  skills...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The more intact old world buildings tend
  to have locked doors. Gotta get in somehow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Jack and Annie are waiting in the tunnel next to a door.
  The handle moves down and they hear the deadbolt retracting with
  a click. The door creaks as Michelle pulls it inward, revealing
  a hallway. She leads the way. James is standing in a door to the left,
  holding it open. They go through and enter the control room, a somewhat
  large room packed with equipment. Across from them are the windows,
  allowing a view of the spillway and the top of the dam, with a random
  assortment of office furniture and a few electronic devices
  <span class="comment">zusammengeschoben? piled up?</span>
  in front of them. The wall to the left is lined with metal cabinets
  with a few buttons, switches, large gauges and levers on them. The wall
  to the right is taken up by storage <span class="comment">cabinets?
  the drawer thingies...</span> and an assortment of large devices and
  contraptions. A bit towards them from the center of the room is
  a large console facing the window front with many buttons, switches,
  gauges, and two telephones on it. Annie walks past it and looks out
  the windows, admiring the flowering lilypads floating behind the dam.
</p>
<p>
  Jack picks up a clipboard and pencil that lay on the center console.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Maintenance checklist for October 2011 &ndash;
  I don&apos;t think anyone has stepped foot in here since Sunside Cove was
  sealed off.</span><br />
  Annie turns around and leans on the console.
  <span class="quote speech">It wouldn&apos;t surprise me. Many people are
  legitimately scared of the outside world.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I mean they&apos;re probably right, the
  outside world is pretty dangerous. Watch your step, by the way...</span>
  <br />
  She looks down and ... <span class="quote speech">Whoa!</span><br />
  Without noticing, she had walked onto a thick glass pane covering
  a large opening in the floor. It allows a view into a hall filled with
  machinery. The floor is flooded by water rushing out of a burst pipe and
  spraying out from the flanges of many other pipe sections.
  <br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s a miracle that there is
  still power being generated here. Michelle, James, have a look down
  there.</span><br />
  Michelle responds: <span class="quote speech">Yeah, we saw on the way in.
  This place is overbuilt to take it.</span><br />
  He walks around the console and tries to get a better look.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks like it might not tale it for much
  longer. All four turbines have water, but only three are spinning.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After a short time discussing with Michelle and flipping through
  the paper on the clipboard, they come up with a plan and Jack sits down
  at the console. He picks up a telephone and dials a number.
  While wedging the receiver between his shoulder and ear, he pulls a few
  pages from the clipboard and lays them out in front of him.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Good afternoon, this is Jack, I am calling
  from the Ivydale hydro power station. Am I talking to infrastructure
  control?</span><br />
  Short pause while he listens.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes, I am.</span><br />
  Another pause.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sir, I don&apos;t care. We have an emergency.
  Am I talking to infrastructure control?</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m not here to answer questions.
  I am calling to inform you of an imminent power outage. Follow procedure
  thirty-nine. Switch the battery banks to autonomous and disconnect the
  transformers.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Follow emergency procedure thirty-nine.</span>
  <br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As I said, I will not answer your
  questions.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Follow the procedure. You have fifteen
  minutes.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Will you do your fucking job already?
  You need to get the city running on backup power <i>right now</i>.
  Questions can be answered later.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">If the grid goes down with the power station,
  that&apos;s on you. Follow emergency procedure thirty-nine. You can call
  me back on the two five five two. Have a good day.</span><br />
  Jack puts the receiver back down and shakes his head.<br />
  <span class="comment">TODO: James is probably unfamiliar with
  telephones.</span>
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, Michelle has gone around and flipped some switches on
  the control panel cabinets to the left. The gauges are lit up and their
  needles no longer sit at their resting points. Jack flips a switch on
  the center console and it lights up like a christmas tree. He gives it
  a once-over, then he presses some buttons on his watch and gets up.
</p>
<p>
  The four climb back outside onto the dam. Jack and James attempt to
  <span class="commenr">man-handle?</span> the mechanism to lower the
  spillway gate. To their surprise, it actually moves and the water flow
  increases.<br />
  <span class="comment">ToDo: something missing here, Idk</span>
</p>
<p>
  A bell starts ringing in the control room. They climb through the window
  again and Michelle sits down at the center console. She hits a button
  and the ringing stops.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Power draw is dropping. Looks like
  they&apos;re doing their part.</span><br />
  Jack looks at his watch.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sixteen minutes. About time...</span><br />
  A few minutes later, the bell goes off again. The needles on most of the
  gauges suddenly swing to zero. The phone rings. Jack answers:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ivydale hydro power station, this is
  Jack.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Affirmative, you are disconnected.</span>
  <br />
  He looks up and holds the receiver away from his mouth.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie, can you flip that big switch?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">This one?</span><br />
  It moves down with a satisfying <i>ka-chonk</i>. Michelle turns
  some <span class="comment">what do you call this style of switch?</span>
  on the console and slowly pulls back one of four levers. The console
  buzzes at her and some status lights start blinking.<br />
  She tries the other three levers, only the third one moves without
  buzzing.<br />
  Jack speaks into the phone again: <span class="quote speech">We&apos;ll
  need to manually shut down three of the turbines. In the meantime,
  is it in your power to gather volunteers?</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As many as we can get. We need people to
  dismantle and rebuild large machinery and plumbing.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t know? Talk to the news or
  something.</span><br />
  &ndash;<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Thanks.</span>
