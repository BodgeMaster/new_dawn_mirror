<h1> Overdue Maintenance </h1>
<p>
  Jack parks the truck just before the exit of a tunnel and they get out.
  Roaring water echoes from somewhere deep below. Annie grabs her bag and
  goes ahead. The tunnel wall to the right features doors, large gates,
  and windows that allow a peek into abandoned offices, storage spaces, and
  control rooms. The end of the tunnel connects to a balcony with walkways
  connecting to either side, extending into a narrow ravine. She steps onto
  it, making sure to keep her distance to the railing, and looks around.
  The walkway to the right connects to the top of a dam blocking the ravine.
  A couple bushes, purple flowers, and a small tree grow on top of it and
  the wall is partially green from moss. Water flows over the spillway,
  falling into the depths below where it joins a torrent of water coming
  from two big pipes at the bottom of the dam.

  She turns around to see Jack getting a toolbox from the truck bed
  <span class="comment">one word or two?</span> and James and Michelle
  waiting next to a door, holding a large box full of random spare parts.
  She hurries over to them and opens it by pulling a loop of wire through
  the latch.
</p>
<p>
  Inside is the main control room. The wall to the right is lined with
  metal cabinets that have levers, buttons, dials, and large gauges on
  them. The wall to the left features a front of windows, allowing a view
  of the spillway and the top of the dam, below which is a random
  collection of furniture, primarily desks and chairs. Some of the windows
  have cracks but, by some miracle, none are broken. The center of the room
  is taken up by a large console with more buttons, switches, and gauges
  that is facing the windows and an opening in the floor covered by a thick
  glass pane.

  They set down their things and roam around the room. Out of nowhere,
  Michelle asks:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Jack, what&apos;s the status on that dome city
  you&apos;re building? You guys only have two years to finish that
  project.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Oh no, I guess we&apos;re gonna have to slack
  less while waiting for bureaucracy to take its course.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Look, the power lines are gonna get hooked up
  to the battery bank in a couple days. Aren&apos;t you excited for
  that?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not my department but I sure hope we&apos;re
  no longer gonna need these portable batteries down there. Having a working
  power grid is gonna be so nice.</span><br />
  They are looking at a calendar on the wall and laughing. It shows October
  1991 with a few entries and crossed-off days.
</p>
<p>
  Jack notices that Annie has unwittingly stepped onto the glass pane.
