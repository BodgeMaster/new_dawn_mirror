<h1> Diesel Creek </h1>

<p>
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">And you really expect to find
  machines here that aren&apos;t beyond repair?</span><br />
  The four are walking into a valley in a large forested area.<br />
  Jack replies: <span class="quote speech">Right now, I&apos;m not even
  sure this is the place &ndash; everything looks so different &ndash; but,
  if it is, we&apos;ll have plenty to choose from and a bunch more for
  spare parts.</span><br />
  James gestures to the side and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Look, over there.</span><br />
  He points out a group of very rusty and completely overgrown machines.
  <br />
  Annie wonders: <span class="quote speech">How did they get inbetween
  the trees?</span><br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">They didn&apos;t. This wasn&apos;t
  a forest back then.</span><br />
  They make their way over to them.
</p>
<p>
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Looks like these were already
  out of order before they were abandoned.</span><br />
  He turns to Annie and James, patting the side of one of the machines.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">This is an excavator. We&apos;re looking for
  a big one like this, maybe a bit smaller, but not as small as that one
  over there.</span><br />
  He points to a small excavator that has a tree growing through
  its cab.<br />
  <span class="comment">Do these excavators where the cab is the biggest
  part have a specific name?</span><br />
  James asks: <span class="quote speech">Why not just use this one then?
  What&apos;s wrong with it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">This thing&apos;s just done for. Looks like
  it was used as a spare parts donor. <span class="comment">Tracks? Treads?
  </span> are missing, hydraulics for the bucket as well, and it looks
  like the inside of the cab got completely dismantled.</span><br />
  They take a quick look at the other machines around them. There is the
  other, much smaller excavator, a <span class="comment">Kipper?</span>,
  a <span class="comment">Wie hei&szlig;t diese Maschine mit
  F&ouml;rderband, die Material sortiert?</span>, and two
  <span class="comment">Radlader? Baccos?</span>. All of them are missing
  significant parts.<br />
</p>
<p>
  A bit further down the valley, they approach a much larger collection of
  machines, parked in rows and parted out like the first ones they saw.
  <br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Welcome to the machine graveyard.
  If memory serves right, there should be a few buildings back there and
  one of the main parking lots behind them.</span><br />
  While they make their way through between the machines, Annie asks:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So these machines dug out the dome?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well... no. That was mostly done using
  explosives, the machines were there to collect the rubble and load it
  onto trains. But they also played a big part in construction after
  the digging was done.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="comment">
  research that needs to be done:
  When were hydraulic excavators invented?
  When did they get the ability to use a jackhammer attachment?
  When did the cable-driven ones go out of fashion?
