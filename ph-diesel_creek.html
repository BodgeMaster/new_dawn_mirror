<h1> Diesel Creek </h1>
<!-- perspective: neutral / (weak) Jack -->

<p>
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">And you really expect to find
  machines here that can be salvaged?</span><br />
  The four are walking into a valley in a large forested area.<br />
  Jack replies: <span class="quote speech">Right now, I&apos;m not even
  sure this is the place &ndash; everything looks so different &ndash; but,
  if it is, we&apos;ll have plenty to choose from and a bunch more for
  spare parts.</span><br />
  James gestures to the side, saying:
  <span class="quote speech">Look, over there.</span><br />
  He points out a group of very rusty and completely overgrown machines.
  <br />
  Annie wonders: <span class="quote speech">How did they get inbetween
  the trees?</span><br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">They didn&apos;t. The machines
  came first, the trees grew after. This wasn&apos;t a forest
  back then.</span><br />
  They make their way over to take a closer look.
</p>
<p>
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Looks like these were already
  out of order before they were abandoned.</span><br />
  He turns to Annie and James:
  <span class="quote speech">This is an excavator. We&apos;re looking for
  a big one like this, maybe a bit smaller, but not as small as that one
  over there &ndash; and preferably without trees growing out of
  it...</span><br />
  He points to a small excavator that sits askew on a thick tree trunk
  that had grown through the floor and out the side.
  <span class="comment">Compact excavator? Tiny excavator?</span><br />
  James asks: <span class="quote speech">Why not just use this one?
  What&apos;s wrong with it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">This thing&apos;s just done for. Apart from it
  being a pile of rust, it&apos;s missing its tracks, the hydraulics for
  moving the bucket, and it looks like the inside of the cab got completely
  dismantled.</span><br />
  They take a quick look at the other machines around them. There is the
  other, much smaller excavator, a dump truck, a <span class="comment">
  what's the name of that machine with a conveyor belt that sorts
  large rocks and rubble from sand?
  <!--
    ChatGPT says "screening plant" but also refers to it as a
    "vibrating belt sorter". Research that.
    It also gives a good description of what it does:
    "splits rubble into chunks, fines, and dust."
  -->
  </span>, and two loaders. All of them
  are rusted beyond repair and missing integral parts.<br />
</p>
<p>
  A bit further down the valley, they approach a much larger collection of
  machines, parked in rows and parted out like the first ones they saw.
  <br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Welcome to the machine graveyard.
  If memory serves right, there should be a few buildings back there and
  one of the main parking lots behind them.</span><br />
  While they make their way through between the machines, Annie asks:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So these machines dug out the dome?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well... no. That was mostly done using
  explosives, conveyor belts, and trains. They used loaders to get the
  stuff onto conveyors but most of the machines here were used in
  construction after the digging was done.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="comment">
  research that needs to be done:
  When were hydraulic excavators invented?
  When did they get the ability to use a jackhammer attachment?
  When did the cable-driven ones go out of fashion?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="comment">missing section</span>
</p>
<p>
  Annie calls the others over to one of the buildings.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Look what I found...</span><br />
  Michelle arrives before Jack and she laughs. He arrives a moment
  later and peeks inside. There sits a cable shovel, partially covered
  in rubble from the caved-in roof &ndash; rusty but surprisingly intact.
  <br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s ... uhhh ... kind of
  a historical artifact.</span><br />
  <!--
  "I mean, everything here is a historical artifact."
  "Fair enough, but this especially so."

  There is also a kinda small hydraulic excavator.
  They decide to make both work.

  This is for another chapter but here is a list of things they might do:
  - strip parts off of other machines
  - modify or create parts at the Ivydale train yard
  - swap out a beyond-repair engine - with a different one that
    doesn't fit ofc
  - weld things to the machines for botched but improved
    structural integrity
  - maybe come up with an alternative for hydraulic fluid if it isn't too
    far fetched, alternatively scavenge it from other machines or trade
    for it
  - find a grabber attachment for the excavator
  - DIY electronics

  <span class="comment">
    Things that need research: Did early hydraulic excavators have starter
    engines (what were they called again?) or was that a thing of the past
    by then?<br />
    Events:<br />
    -> they take off some access panels<br />
    -> they manage to get the starte engine going<br />
    -> large engine won't start (why?)<br />
