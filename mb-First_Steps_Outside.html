<h1> First Steps Outside</h1>
<p>
  The station is is much larger than any of the metro stations inside the
  dome. It has many platforms. Portions of the tall roof that is supported
  by large stone pillars and rusty steel beams have caved in and what&apos;s
  still standing has holes. Rays of light poke through holes in the walls
  and the roof. All of that is visually stunning but what really catches
  Annie&apos;s eyes are the plants everywhere. Parts of the platforms are
  densely covered in the thin, green blades of some plant giving them a
  fuzzy look. Vines cling to the walls and pillars, crawl along gaps and
  edges, and hang from the rusty beams and the fringes of the caved in roof
  sections. Moss grows on the rusted benches and trash cans.
</p>
<p>
  Jack turns off the generator and decelerates the train. Clanging from
  under the floor followed by the squeaking of the brakes. The train runs
  over a bunch of bushes and tall flowers that have taken root on the
  tracks before coming to a halt next to a staircase in the center of the
  platform.<br />
  <span class="speech">Exit to the right</span>, he says in unison with the
  automated voice while turning the switch for the doors and gesturing
  towards the passenger area.<br />
  <span class="speech">After you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Annie walks over to the closest door and pushes the button. Pressurized
  air hisses and the right half opens very slowly. They step out onto the
  platform. Annie breathes the warm air. It smells of the run-over plants.
  Insects are buzzing about, and the wind rustles through the leaves. She
  crouches down and touches the carpet of green fuzziness.<br />
  <span class="speech">Grass. It grows pretty much everywhere, usually much
  taller than this though.</span><br />
  She looks up at him.<br />
  <span class="speech">I knew there would be more plants out here... I
  didn&apos;t expect that many of them.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Welcome to the outside world. Wanna take a quick
  look around?</span><br />
  She gets up.<br />
  <span class="speech">Sure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They walk down a flight of stairs taking them to a tunnel under the
  platforms. The floor is covered in water so they follow a ledge on the
  side. Jack leads Annie up the stairs to the last platform. From there,
  they step outside through a side entrance.
</p>
<p>
  Annie is hit by the light and warmth of the setting sun. She closes her
  eyes and faces it for a moment.<br />
  <span class="speech">This is nice.</span> She turns to Jack.
  <span class="speech">And this light is just always up there?</span><br />
  Jack chuckles. <span class="speech">Well... No. Only during the
  day.</span><br />
  Annie looks around. They are standing on a balcony-like platform
  overlooking a city in a valley.<br />
  <span class="speech">Wooow</span>, she utters in astonishment.<br />
  <span class="speech">Ivydale - or at least what remains of it.</span>
  <br />
  She walks over to the rusted railing and goes to lean against it.<br />
  <span class="speech">Don&apos;t lean on that.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Why not?</span><br />
  She steps back.<br />
  <span class="speech">Watch.</span><br />
  He pushes against it. Loud cracking follows, and the ringing of metal.
  A roughly two meter wide section of the railing breaks loose and falls.
  Annie takes a bigger step back. The railing crashes into the ground
  below with a loud ringing bang.<br />
  <span class="speech">How did you know?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">I made the same mistake over there.</span><br />
  He points to another missing section in the railing that Annie
  hadn&apos;t noticed before.<br />
  <span class="speech">Be careful around old buildings.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Cautiously stepping back to the edge, Annie looks down. Bushes cover the
  hillside below the tall embankment wall that holds the station,
  overgrowing everything. The walls of small ruins and half fallen-in
  fences stick out here and there, and the bushes are interrupted by what
  remains of roads and staircases. Small rivers cut through the landscape.
  Annie looks up. The ruins further down the valley are larger the closer
  they are to the center of the urban area below.<br />
  <span class="speech">It&apos;s much bigger than &lt;dome city&gt;.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Many things are bigger than &lt;dome city&gt;.
  This is the smaller of two sister cities.</span><br />
  He points towards another urban center in the distance.<br />
  <span class="speech">That over there is Sentinel Shores, the place
  I used to call home.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  At some point before this, Jack needs to tell her something along the
  lines of &quot;No pity. I chose this life.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  After pointing out some other notable landmarks, Jack decides it is time
  to get going. He starts to lead the way, walking to the end of the end of
  the station that they entered it from, before abruptly turning to Annie.
  <span class="speech">You know what we forgot?</span>
</p>
<p>
  They return to the side entrance, walk down the stairs, follow the ledge,
  back up the stairs, and end up at the train. Annie puts the documents
  back into her bag. Jack grabs the keys from the control panel
  <span class="speech">just for good measure</span> and uses one of them to
  close the door from the outside.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  I don't like this. It feels too contrived. Would have been better if
  Jack had just closed the door when they left the train and left it at
  that. That also allows for a later scene where someone realizes that
  the documents are still in the train.
</p>
<p>
  Jack leads the way again, this time walking to the end of the platform
  where the tunnels open up into the station. There, they use another
  underpass taking them to the end of the balcony-like walkway. It
  connects to a wide staircase down from the end of the embankment
  where the mountain extends over the tunnels and the back wall of the
  station. It leads to a collapsed bridge next to a large waterfall.
  Annie marvels at the sheer amount of water flowing by, something that
  she has never seen before.
</p>
<p>
  Jack goes ahead, climbing down the wall where the bridge used to begin
  by grabbing onto the edges of the large sandstone blocks. Annie struggles
  to follow. After what feels like an eternity, she manages to get half-way
  down the wall.<br />
  <span class="speech">You can jump from there.</span><br />
  They make their way across the fast-flowing river by stepping on large
  stones in the water, and continue through the bushes towards Outpost 53.
