For some reason, I am thinking about what happens after the end of the story.
So uhh... Here we go, I guess:

Emily wakes up. She's laying in bed, looking out of the panorama window -
what an odd déjà-vu in a world that is so different.
Annie and Michelle are sitting on the floor playing cards.
<description of a part of Nova Metropolis that has been damaged by the impact>
Michelle nods towards her, Annie turns around.
"Hey, good morning. How was your night?"
"Awful. Everything is so heavy."
Emily pushes herself up and looks around.
"Where are the others?"
Annie turns back to the window and points outside.
Michelle grabs a radio and talks into it:
"Jack, where are you? She's awake."
They momentarily see the glint of a mirror being held into the sunlight from
half-way up a sky scraper on the other side of the crater.
"What are thy doing over there?"
Annie shakes her head.
"I forgot to turn my radio off yesterday. Cue Jack waking us up just before
dawn - he heard people talking. They're taking the big radio up to that antenna
over there."
