For some reason, I am thinking about what happens after the end of the story. So uhh... Here we go, I guess:

Emily wakes up. She’s laying in bed, looking out of the panorama window - what an odd déjà-vu in a world that is so different.
Annie and Michelle are sitting on the floor playing cards. <description of a part of Nova Metropolis that has been damaged by the impact>
Michelle nods towards her, Annie turns around.
"Good morning. How was your night?"
"Awful. Everything is so heavy."
She pushes herself up and looks around.
"Where are the others?"
Michelle grabs a radio and talks into it:
"Jack, she’s awake."
Annie leans back to look out of the window. Emily looks in the same direction and momentarily sees the glint of a mirroring object being held
into the sunlight from one of the other buildings.
"What are thy doing over there?"
Annie shakes her head.
"I forgot to turn my radio off yesterday. Cue Jack waking me up just before dawn - he supposedly heard someone talking."
