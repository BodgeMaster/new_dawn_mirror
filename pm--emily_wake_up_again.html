<h1>&lt;Emily wake up again&gt;</h1>
<p>
  Emily wakes up in her bed, laying on her side. Lena is sitting on the
  floor in front of her, leaning against the window, with her arms over
  her knees and her head resting on them. She looks very pale. A few
  thoughts flash through Emily&apos;s mind in quick succession:
  <span class="quote non-speech">asleep or dead &mdash; she moved a tiny
  bit, she&apos;s breathing &mdash; asleep, phew.</span><br />
  Emily moves into a more comfortable position. Lena
  <span class="comment">zuckt zusammen</span> and lifts her head, looking
  disoriented for a moment.<br />
  She says in a weak voice: <span class="quote speech">So you will
  live.</span><br />
  Emily sits up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">How long has it been?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">About three days.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Have you slept at all?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Here and there a bit.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You need to sleep.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Funny you should say that... I couldn&apos;t
  sleep because I was worried about you little devil.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They get up and walk down the hallway towards the main control center.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">While you were unconscious, I managed to get
  in touch with someone on Earth. Well, they really got in touch with
  me.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So it is true that there are still people
  down there... How did they do that?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There is some old, long disused radio
  equipment in the control center that they reactivated.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">How?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s something you&apos;re gonna
  have to ask them. Apparently, there is no way to fully disable it.
  They seem to have extensive technical documentation on all of our
  systems. I only noticed their activity when I heard a phone
  ringing in here and went to investigate.</span><br />
  They reach the door to the control center module. Lena punches her code
  into the keypad, a computer voice says
  <span class="quote speech">access authorized</span> and the door slides
  up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech"></span>
