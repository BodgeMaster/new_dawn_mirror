<h1>&lt;Emily wake up again&gt;</h1>
<p>
  Emily wakes up in her bed, laying on her side. Lena is sitting on the
  floor in front of her, leaning against the window, with her arms over
  her knees and her head resting on them. She looks very pale. A few
  thoughts flash through Emily&apos;s mind in quick succession:
  <span class="quote non-speech">asleep or dead &mdash; she moved a tiny
  bit, she&apos;s breathing &mdash; asleep, phew.</span><br />
  Emily moves into a more comfortable position. Lena
  <span class="comment">schrekt hoch</span> and looks disoriented for
  a moment.<br />
  She says in a weak voice: <span class="quote speech">So you will
  live.</span><br />
  Emily sits up.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">How long has it been?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">About three days.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Have you slept at all?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Here and there a little bit.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You need to sleep.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Funny you should say that...</span>
