<h1>Unhappy Engine Noises</h1>

<!--
I started writing this to prepend to the chapter. Not sure where I was going
with this so I'll just leave it in here, commented out.

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">What are the odds it&apos;s just gonna
  work?</span><br />
  Michelle&apos;s eyes wander around the driver&apos;s cabin.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Batteries are dead so it&apos;s not gonna
  start. Will it run? No idea.</span><br />
  Jack pulls a key out of his pocket and inserts it into a key switch on
  the control panel. He turns the key and &ndash; as expected &ndash;
  nothing happens.
  <span class="quote speech">Guess we&apos;ll need to find a power source
  then.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The two roam around the hall, looking for a generator or anything that
  could be abused as one. Michelle makes her way to an area with
  workbenches and all sorts of tools. Jack looks at the crates and boxes on
  the closest one of the huge shelves.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I ... uhh... found one. No idea how we&apos;re
  gonna get to it though.</span><br />
  Jack stands in front of the shelf, looking at a large crate that&apos;s
  about 2m above him.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Please let that not be the only option.</span>
</p>

  Michelle pokes her head out from underneath the train.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think that&apos;s it.</span><br/>
  She puts a large piece of leftover hose aside and crawls out.<br >
  <span class="quote speech">That was quick. Nice work.</span><br />
  Jack walks over to the compartment holding the batteries, takes the cables
  off the terminals, and hooks them up to his makeshift power supply. Then,
  he starts the generator and climbs into the train. Michelle follows him
  and they go to the driver&apos;s cabin. Jack turns the key switch and
  parts of the dashboard light up. He flips the switch for the fuel pump.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, this is progress already.</span><br />
  He points to the fuel pressure gauge; the needle slowly creeps to the
  right. He pushes engine start button. The engine begins to turn over but
  it doesn&apos;t start. He holds the button. The engine begins to turn
  over again. After a moment, it accelerates but it still doesn&apos;t run.
  He keeps holding the button for a while but the engine won&apos;t start.
