<h1>Unhappy Engine Noises</h1>
<p>
  Michelle pokes her head out from underneath the train.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think that&apos;s it.</span><br/>
  She puts a large piece of leftover hose aside and crawls out.<br >
  <span class="quote speech">That was quick. Nice work.</span><br />
  Jack walks over to the compartment holding the batteries, takes the cables
  off the terminals, and hooks them up to his makeshift power supply. Then,
  he starts the generator and climbs into the train. Michelle follows him
  and they go to the driver&apos;s cabin. Jack turns the key switch and
  parts of the dashboard light up. He flips the switch for the fuel pump.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, this is progress already.</span><br />
  He points to the fuel pressure gauge; the needle slowly creeps to the
  right. He pushes engine start button. The engine begins to turn over but
  it doesn&apos;t start. He holds the button. The engine begins to turn
  over again. After a moment, it accelerates but it still doesn&apos;t run.
  He keeps holding the button for a while but the engine won&apos;t start.
