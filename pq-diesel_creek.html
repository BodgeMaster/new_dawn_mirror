<h1> Diesel Creek </h1>

<p>
  Michelle asks: <span class="quote speech">And you really expect to find
  one here that isn&apos;t beyond repair?</span><br />
  They are walking into a valley in a large forested area.<br />
  Jack replies: <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m not even sure this is
  the right place. Everything looks so different. But if it is, we&apos;ll
  have plenty to choose from. Not optimistic about any of the hydraulic
  excavators but we had some older cable-driven diggers
  <span class="comment">right word?</span> on site that we might get
  working.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">research that needs to be done:
  When were hydraulic excavators invented?
  When did they get the ability to use a jackhammer attachment?
  When did the cable-driven ones go out of fashion?</span><br />
  James says: <span class="quote speech">Look, over there.</span><br />
  He gestures towards a group of very rusty and completely overgrown
  machines and vehicles standing amidst the trees.<br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">That one to the right is similar to
   what we&apos;re looking for.</span><br />
  They walk up to the machines.<br />
  Jack turns to Annie and James, patting the side of the machine he pointed
  out a moment earlier. It has a sort of arm in the front with a huge scoop
  thingy on the end.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re looking for something like this but
  with steel cables going from back here up there and to the boom.</span>
  <br />
  James asks: <span class="quote speech">Why not use this one?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">&apos;Cause this thing&apos;s done for.
  Beyond repair, as Michelle put it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">How can you tell?</span><br />
  Jack walks to the front and points to some parts on the arm of the
  machine. <span class="quote speech">These rods used to extend and retract
  to move the boom. They need to be perfectly smooth and fit together
  exactly or they&apos;ll leak the oil inside.</span><br />
  They take a quick look at the other machines. There is another, smaller
  excavator, a <span class="comment">Kipper?</span>, a <span class="comment">
  Wie hei&szlig;t diese Maschine mit F&ouml;rderband, die Material sortiert?
  </span>, and two <span class="comment">Radlader?</span>.<br />
  Annie asks: <span class="quote speech">How did all of these get
  inbetween the trees?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The trees weren&apos;t here when they were
  used. This is why I had such a hard time finding this place.</span><br />



  Annie asks: <span class="quote speech">Is this how the dome was dug
  out?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well... no. That was mostly done using
  explosives. But we had a large fleet of machines for all sorts of
  tasks.</span><br />
