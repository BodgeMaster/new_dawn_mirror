<h1>&lt;Nova Metropolis&gt;</h1>
<p>
  Michelle continues driving the bus for a couple hours without further
  incidents. They pass a bunch of smaller towns, some of them being
  basically piles of wood and rubble while others have buildings that are
  still standing. James had gone to sleep and Annie is enjoying the view,
  making occasional conversation with Michelle about landmarks or anything
  remarkable.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Maybe add some comment about what Annie sees/perceives?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Look, over there!</span><br />
  Michelle points to the left. An undefined shape is visible in the far
  distance. She takes an exit onto another highway in that direction. After
  a short while, the undefined shape turns into the unmistakable skyline of
  a large city.
</p>
<p>
  The bus passes a large sign &quot;Welcome to Nova Metropolis&quot; and
  they reach the city outskirts. Many of the single family homes in the area
  are still standing, some of them even in remarkably good condition. The
  skyscrapers in the distance look like they&apos;re all intact.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  some reaction to the fact that the city is basically intact
</p>
<p>
  The highway ends and transitions into a large road. Michelle decelerates
  the bus.<br />
  <span class="speech">Why are you going so slow?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Im going exactly 50 - perfectly normal city
  speed.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">50 km/h? That's faster than the speed limit in
  &lt;dome city&gt;. This feels so slow...</span><br />
  Michelle chuckles.<br />
  <span class="speech">Well Jack was right about the wind - I managed to go
  120 most of the time. Under normal circumstances, a bus like this one
  would struggle with that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The buildings around them get taller and taller. The mix of smaller and
  medium-sized houses turns into blocks of five-story buildings which in
  turn turn into blocks of even taller buildings until the sides are lined
  with sky scrapers with facades of glass, concrete, and steel towering
  over over the road. Annie points them out:<br />
  <span class="comment">TODO: tie this in with the missing section
  above.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">They all look like they were just abandoned.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">You're right. Not even a smashed window...</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Over there?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Okay, one smashed window.</span><br />
  Michelle pulls up at a bus stop and parks the bus.<br />
  <span class="speech">Time to wake up the guys.</span>
</p>
<p>
  While enjoying a small meal, they decide to explore the time capsule that
  is Nova Metropolis. Well, all of them but Jack.<br />
  <span class="speech">I thought sleep was for the weak?</span> Michelle
  teases him.<br />
  <span class="speech">I'm just gonna own that one today.</span><br />
  He throws himself into his bed, not even making an effort to lay down in a
  comfortable position. Through the mattress, they hear a muffled
  <span class="speech">Good night</span>.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Jack is gone</span>, Annie notices while entering
  the bus. She goes to the kitchen area.<br />
  <span class="speech">There&apos;s a note on the table: &quot;Will be back
  at 6:30&quot;</span><br />
  Michelle looks at her watch.<br />
  <span class="speech">It <i>is</i> 6:30.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">I guess there&apos;s nothing to do but wait.
  He&apos;ll show up soon enough.</span> James chimes in.<br />
  They place their bags full of found goodies on the floor and sit down
  around the table.
</p>
<p>
  After a while, they hear a fast car approaching. Looking outside, they
  see an oldtimer &lt;zoom&gt; by. A moment later, it returns, braking so
  hard that it leaves tire marks on the road. Jack gets out and waves at
  them. He turns off the engine and walks to the front of the bus. Annie
  opens the door.<br />
  <span class="speech">Where have you been?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">Jack has misremembered where they parked the bus so
  he was searching for them.</span>
