<h1>&lt;Nova Metropolis&gt;</h1>
<p>
  Michelle continues driving the bus for a couple hours without further
  incidents. They pass a bunch of smaller towns, some of them being
  basically piles of wood and rubble while others have buildings that are
  still standing. James had gone to sleep and Annie is enjoying the view,
  making occasional conversation with Michelle about landmarks or anything
  remarkable.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Maybe add some comment about what Annie sees/perceives?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Look, over there!</span><br />
  Michelle points to the left. An undefined shape is visible in the far
  distance. She takes an exit onto another highway in that direction. After
  a short while, the undefined shape turns into the unmistakable skyline of
  a large city.
</p>
<p>
  The bus passes a large sign &quot;Welcome to Nova Metropolis&quot; and
  they reach the city outskirts. Many of the single family homes in the area
  are still standing, some of them even in remarkably good condition. The
  skyscrapers in the distance look like they&apos;re all intact.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  some reaction to the fact that the city is basically intact
</p>
<p>
  The highway ends and transitions into a large road. Michelle decelerates
  the bus.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Why are you going so slow?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Im going exactly 50 - perfectly normal city
  speed.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">50 km/h? That's faster than the speed limit in
  &lt;dome city&gt;. This feels so slow...</span><br />
  Michelle chuckles.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well Jack was right about the wind - I managed
  to go 120 most of the time. Under normal circumstances, a bus like this
  one would struggle with that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The buildings around them get taller and taller. The mix of smaller and
  medium-sized houses turns into blocks of five-story buildings which in
  turn turn into blocks of even taller buildings until the sides are lined
  with sky scrapers with facades of glass, concrete, and steel towering
  over over the road. Annie points them out:<br />
  <span class="comment">TODO: tie this in with the missing section
  above.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">They all look like they were just
  abandoned.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You're right. Not even a smashed
  window...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Over there?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, one smashed window.</span><br />
  Michelle pulls up at a bus stop and parks the bus.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Time to wake up the guys.</span>
</p>
<p>
  While enjoying a small meal, they decide to explore the time capsule that
  is Nova Metropolis. Well, all of them but Jack.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I thought sleep was for the weak?</span>
  Michelle teases him.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I'm just gonna own that one today.</span><br />
  He throws himself into his bed, not even making an effort to lay down in a
  comfortable position. Through the mattress, they hear a muffled
  <span class="quote speech">Good night</span>.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section (and maybe a missing chapter of Jack getting the radio)
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Jack is gone</span>, Annie notices while
  entering the bus. She goes to the kitchen area.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a note on the table: &quot;Will
  be back at 6:30&quot;</span><br />
  Michelle looks at her watch. <span class="quote speech">It <i>is</i>
  6:30.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I guess there&apos;s nothing to do but wait.
  He&apos;ll show up soon enough.</span> James chimes in.<br />
  They place their bags full of found goodies on the floor and sit down
  around the table.
</p>
<p>
  After a while, they hear a fast car approaching. Looking outside, they
  see an oldtimer <span class="comment">zoom</span> by. Michelle says:
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s him.</span> A moment later, the
  car returns, braking so hard it leaves tire marks on the road. Jack gets
  out and waves at them. He turns off the engine and walks to the front of
  the bus. Annie opens the door.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Where have you been?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I went on my own little adventure and may or
  may not have forgotten where the bus was parked.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Didn&apos;t you go to sleep?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well yeah... And then I had a dream that
  inspired me to go looking for a radio.</span> He points to the car he
  arrived in. <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s in the trunk.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">said dream is him running a radio station talking
  to Emily</span><br />
  Michelle facepalms. Annie and James look at both of them in confusion.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is it one of these radios?</span> Michelle
  makes a gesture like turning a dial.<br />
  <span class="comment">Yes, it is. Make this clear when Jack picks it
  up.</span>
