<h1>Nova Metropolis</h1>
<p>
  Michelle continues driving the bus for a couple hours without further
  incidents. They pass a bunch of smaller towns, some reduced to
  basically piles of wood and rubble while others have buildings still
  standing. James had gone to sleep and Annie is enjoying the view,
  making occasional conversation with Michelle about landmarks or anything
  remarkable.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle gets her attention: <span class="quote speech">Look, almost
  there!</span><br />
  She getures to the left. Annie leans out of her seat and back to see what
  Michelle is pointing to. An undefined shape is visible in the far
  distance. Michelle takes an exit onto another highway in that direction.
  After not too long, the undefined shape turns into the unmistakable
  skyline of a large city.
</p>
<p>
  They pass a huge sign with completely washed-out colors that still
  faintly reads <span class="quote non-speech">Welcome to
  Nova&nbsp;Metropolis</span>. Quickly, they find themselves the city
  outskirts. Many of the single family homes in the area are still
  standing, some of them even in remarkably good condition. The city
  center ahead of them is made up of skyscrapers that mostly look like
  the day they were abandoned.
</p>
<p>
  The highway ends and transitions into a large road. Michelle decelerates
  the bus.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Why are you going so slow?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Im going exactly speed limit - 50 km/h.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">50? That's faster than the speed limit in
  Sunside Cove yet this feels so slow...</span><br />
  Michelle chuckles.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">This is what it feels like coming off the
  highway. Jack was right about the wind. Under normal circumstances,
  a bus like this one would struggle to reach 100, we were doing 120.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The buildings around them get taller and taller. The mix of smaller and
  medium-sized houses turns into blocks of five-story buildings which in
  turn turn into blocks of even taller buildings until the sides are lined
  with sky scrapers with facades of glass, concrete, and steel towering
  over over the road. Annie points them out:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Looks like this was all abandoned just
  recently. Not even a smashed window.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Over there.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, one smashed window.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I mean you&apos;re right. Barely any
  damage &ndash; and surprisingly little sand, I thought we&apos;d
  find a bunch of half-buried ruins.</span><br />
  Michelle pulls up at a bus stop and parks the bus.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Time to wake up the guys.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Over a small meal, they decide to explore the time capsule that
  is Nova Metropolis. Well, all of them but Jack.<br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">I thought sleep was for
  the weak?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I'm just gonna own that one today.</span><br />
  He throws himself onto his bed, not even making an effort to lay down in
  a comfortable position. His words are muffled through the mattres:
  <span class="quote speech">Good night.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section (and maybe a missing chapter of Jack getting the radio)
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Jack is gone</span>, Annie notices while
  entering the bus. She looks around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">There&apos;s a note on the table: &quot;Will
  be back at 6:30&quot;</span><br />
  Michelle looks at her watch. <span class="quote speech">It <i>is</i>
  6:30.</span><br />
  James chimes in: <span class="quote speech">I guess there&apos;s nothing
  to do but wait. He&apos;ll show up soon enough.</span><br />
  Michelle says: <span class="quote speech">I sure hope so.</span><br />
  They place their bags full of found goodies on the floor and sit down
  around the table.
</p>
<p>
  After a while, they hear a fast car approaching. Looking outside, they
  see an oldtimer <span class="comment">zoom</span> by. Michelle says:
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s him.</span> A moment later, the
  car returns, braking so hard it leaves tire marks on the road. Jack gets
  out and waves at them. He turns off the engine and walks to the front of
  the bus. Annie opens the door.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Where have you been?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I went on my own little adventure and may or
  may not have procured some radio equipment.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Didn&apos;t you want to sleep?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well yeah... And then I had a dream that
  inspired me to go looking for stuff.</span> He points to the car he
  arrived in. <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s in the trunk.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">said dream is him running a radio station and Emily
  calling in as a guest</span><br />
  Michelle facepalms. Annie and James look at both of them in confusion.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is it one of these radios?</span> Michelle
  makes a gesture showing a big box.<br />
  <span class="comment">Yes, it is. Make this clear when Jack picks it
  up.</span>
