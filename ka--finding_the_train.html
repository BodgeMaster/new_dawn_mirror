<p class="comment">
  Context: They are exploring the Ivydale train yard
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Michelle! Look what I found...</span><br />
  She climbs through the gap between the rotting cars on the adjacent
  track.<br />
  <span class="speech">Where are you?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Up here.</span><br />
  Jack had climbed onto the rather sketchy-looking roof of one of the
  trains. Michelle climbs onto the link between cars and Jack helps her to
  the top.<br />
  <span class="comment"> Look,</span>
  <span class="speech">Over there...</span><br />
  He points across the deteriorating metro trains towards the outermost
  track of the overgrown train yard. A small roof - or in places what
  remains of it - extends over the track from the side of a large building.
  Under the roof are several tank cars. Some are rusted through or missing
  parts, but a few look like they might still hold liquids.<br />
  <span class="speech">Oh, wow! Maybe there&apos;s some gas left in there or
  something...</span><br />
  <span class="speech">My thought. Let&apos;s check it out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They climb back down and make their way over to one of the tank cars.
  They climb onto the side of the car and Jack attempts to use the ladder
  that leads to the top. It crumbles under his feet.<br />
  <span class="speech">I guess I found the way down - hey, use me as a
  ladder.</span><br />
  He leans against the car and helps her onto the tank.
  <span class="comment"> something missing? Idk </span>
  Michelle inspects the lid.<br />
  <span class="speech">Do we have a wrench or something?</span><br />
  Jack looks around.<br />
  <span class="speech">I don&apos;t know. Lemme take a look inside
  there...</span><br />
  He disappears through where used to be a door. After a moment, he
  reappears, triumphantly holding a large adjustable wrench.<br />
  <span class="speech">It&apos;s a bit rusty but should do the job.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">I&apos;m afraid to see what you call very
  rusty.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">This thing, for example.</span><br />
  He knocks it against the ladder on the side of the tank causing more
  pieces to break off. Then, he hands the wrench to her. After a bit of
  fiddling, she manages to get a good grip on one of the nuts holding the
  lid in place - it doesn&apos;t budge.<br />
  <span class="speech">Need a hammer or something?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Can you hand me that pipe? It should do.</span><br />
  Jack picks up a section of metal pipe and passes it to her. Putting it
  over the wrench for additional leverage, she pushes against it until the
  bolt snaps with a bang.<br />
  <span class="speech">Well that&apos;s one way for that to come off.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section: Michelle opens the lid and finds some disappointing
  fact - it&apos;s empty or whatever<br />
  then repeat for another one
</p>
<p>
  The contents of the next tank are more promising.<br />
  <span class="speech">Smells like diesel... We should go find a truck or
  something to drive around.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Okay, uhh, stupid idea but I need to show you
  something.</span><br />
  Jack grins.<br />
  <span class="speech">Oh no, what are you up to again?</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Nothing in particular... Wanna follow me for a
  sec?</span><br />
  Michelle jumps down onto the edge of the car, then to the ground and
  follows him to the entrance.
</p>
<p>
  He walks over the door on the floor, past a counter to the left, into the
  wide open hall. It is dimly lit by the light that makes it through the
  dirty windows and small holes in the surprisingly intact roof.
  <span class="comment">note: Make it more clear that the windows are
  below the roof. Also, I imagine them to be milky windows for some reason.
  </span> A few rows of large industrial shelves on the other side of the
  hall hold partially rotting crates. On either side of the area with the
  shelves are spacious areas with machine tools, small cranes, and other
  machinery. A few plants grow here and there. A single train tack goes
  through the center of the hall with additional tracks for a gantry crane
  to either side of it. At the end of the hall to the right, below the
  rusty crane, sits a train wrapped up in tarps.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Stupid idea indeed</span>, she says while walking
  towards it. Then, she corrects herself: <span class="speech">Actually, it
  might not be that stupid. It should have a generator that we can
  use.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">That is if we can get it to a location where it
  would be useful.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Is there a railroad close to the bunker?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="speech">Not that I know of, the closest would be somewhere
  around Ivydale South.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">Okay, not very useful. Let&apos;s go find a truck
  then.</span>
