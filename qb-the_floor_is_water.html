  Jack turns the key and the gate starts to move up, scrathcing and
  squeeking as it does, revealing a bunch of crates. About half-way
  up, it gets stuck, making a buzzing noise. He lets go of the key and it
  stops. They duck under the gate and look around. They find themselves in
  a warehouse much larger than the gate and windows facing the tunnel would
  lead to assume.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call
  an adequate stockpile of spare parts.</span><br />
  Jack walks up to a huge crate and wipes the dust off the label:
  <span class="quote non-speech">Turbine C, replacement 2</span>.
