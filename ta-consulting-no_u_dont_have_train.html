<h1> Consulting </h1>
<p class="comment">
  The following is a conversation between Jack and someone from the
  train company.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Why wouldn&apos;t they work outside? It&apos;s
  not like they&apos;re magically gonna come off the rails once they leave
  the dome.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">All of your trains are outfitted with
  fail-safe emergency brakes. On power loss, you have about 15 seconds
  before they are applied and the train comes to an abrupt, unscheduled
  halt. You can&apos;t even tow these things without power.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I thought you said the tracks were in decent
  shape? Why would the <span class="comment">contacts? sliders?</span>
  come off the power rail for that long?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">A) I didn&apos;t, I said they are in
  <i>surprisingly</i> decent shape after being exposed to the elements
  for a century without any maintenance. B) That power rail isn&apos;t
  gonna be of any use because it doesn&apos;t deliver any power.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">What do you mean? Why not?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Where does the rail get its power from?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">The power grid.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not quite, but close enough. What do we not
  have outside?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Of course there is a power grid outside.
  It&apos;s what powered the old world just as ours powers the city.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">There used to be one, that much is correct,
  but it hasn&apos;t been used or maintained in a century. Even if you did
  somehow manage to get part of it working, I still wouldn&apos;t trust it.
  And where would you wanna get the electricity to run it from?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">From a substation. We fix up one of those and
  use it to power the grid.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Great, now you have a local grid attached to
  the high voltage grid. And what do you wanna power that with?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What? The substations make the power.
  It&apos;s where all the power in the city comes from: Two substations
  &ndash; one in the wall next to this airlock and the other one is by
  the other airlock.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">There is a third one deep below Central
  Square. These are indeed where the electricity in the city comes from
  but they don&apos;t make it. They get it from a power plant outside,
  a bit northeast of here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">The dome powered by the outside world?
  People be believing strange things these days...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t have to believe. I was there when
  the city was built and, more recently, I helped replace a failing
  generator at said power plant. You might have noticed the outage.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhuh, sure buddy. Since you&apos;ve been doing
  nothing but spewing nonsense all this time, I&apos;m just gonna have one
  of our guys drive a train up there and we&apos;ll see what happens.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;ll get some popcorn. Watching this is
  gonna be fun...</span>
</p>
<p>
  The rails start ringing and a train of the Sunside Cove Metro approaches.
  It slows down and comes to a halt before the power rail&apos;s gap for
  the switches in front of the closed airlock. Inside are a driver and the
  railway official. Jack reaches into his backpack, grabs a bag of chips
  &ndash; he didn&apos;t find any popcorn for the occasion &ndash; and
  opens it. The headlights turn off and the driver leaves the driver&apos;s
  cabin. A moment later, the first door opens and he climbs out.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No, I am only going to drive the first segment
  in there. We don&apos;t need the entire train stuck in the tunnel if it
  doesn&apos;t go to plan.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s gonna be fine. What could go
  wrong?</span><br />
  Jack replies loudly so both of them hear him:
  <span class="quote speech">A lot.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You shut up.</span><br />
  The driver says: <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m inclined to agree
  with him.</span><br />
  He turns around and walks to the end of the first railcar where he
  proceeds to detach the hoses and cables and unhooks the couplings.
  Then, he returns to the front and climbs back inside.
</p>
<p>
  The headlights come back on and a compressor kicks into action.
  A few contactors click inside the train. After a moment, the door closes.
  The train sits like this for a few minutes until the compressor turns off
  again. Jack shoves a handfull of chips into his mouth. The inner door
  of the airlock begins to open, creaking and buzzing as it slowly moves
  up.
</p>
<p>
  The motors begin to hum and the first car of the train starts moving
  towards the airlock. It loses power as it rolls over the switches
  and the headlights dim. Jack puts his bag of chips aside and presses
  the button on his watch that lights up the display. He begins to count
  in his head:
  <br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">One, two, three, four, five...</span><br />
  The railcar rolls completely into the airlock. It&apos;s still
  decently far away from the other door.<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Six, seven, eight, nine...</span><br />
  It rolls deeper into the airlock, beyond Jack&apos;s view.<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Ten, eleven...</span><br />
  Loud hissing sounds from inside the airlock &ndash; the train&apos;s
  failsafe mechanism begins to release the pressurized air from its tanks.
  <br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...</span><br />
  A loud <i>clunk</i> followed by screeching and grinding noises as the
  emergency brakes are applied.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Fifteen.</span><br />
  Jack grabs his bag of chips and gets up. He walks onto the tracks and
  looks into the airlock, stuffing his face as he watches the dim
  <span class="comment">R&uuml;cklichter? rear lights?</span> go out.
</p>
<p>
  A few minutes pass and nothing happens. Eventually, Jack hears one of
  the doors getting unlocked with a key and sees it getting pushed open
  by hand. He gets off the track and sits back down next to the rails,
  continuing to stuff his face with chips. A bit later, he watches the
  driver and the railway official doing the walk of shame, the latter
  seeming pretty close to an aneurysm.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Told you so.</span><br />
  The railway official loses it completely, <span class="comment">stampfen?
  </span> and jumping around while screaming some apparently very colorful
  language &ndash; Jack doesn&apos;t understand a single word.
</p>
<p class="comment">
  The train driver proceeds to walk to the rest of the train but Jack stops
  him.
  "It&apos;s too far back. There are only two feasible ways to get it
  back out: Getting power on the track inside the airlock or dismantling
  the brakes so it can be towed."
