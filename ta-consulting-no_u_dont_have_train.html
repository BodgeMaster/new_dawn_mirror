<h1> Consulting </h1>

<p class="comment">
  The following is a conversation between Jack and someone from the
  train company.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">If it is as you say then why don&apos;t you go
  over there and touch that power rail?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Because I&apos;m not stupid.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Because you&apos;re lying. You&apos;re just
  in kahoots with them to keep us all inside.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sir, I&apos;m done arguing with
  you. I told you twice that it is never a good idea to to touch these.
  I told you what you could do instead. Go ahead with your bone-headed
  plan, get a train to the airlock and find out for yourself.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Leaving you alone here so you can sabotage
  ...?</span><br />
  Jack cuts him off: <span class="quote speech">In fact, I am gonna leave
  and see if I can find some popcorn. Watching this is gonna be
  fun...</span>
</p>
<p>
  The rails start ringing and a train of the Sunside Cove Metro approaches.
  It slows down and comes to a halt before the switches in front of the
  closed airlock. In the cab are a driver and the railway official.
  Jack, sitting next to the rails, reaches into his bag of chips &ndash;
  he didn&apos;t find any popcorn for the occasion &ndash; and shoves
  a handful into his mouth. The headlights turn off and the driver leaves.
  A moment later, the first door opens and he jumps out.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">No, I am only going to drive the first segment
  in there. We don&apos;t need the entire train stuck in the tunnel if it
  doesn&apos;t go to plan.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">It&apos;s gonna be fine. What could go
  wrong?</span><br />
  Jack says (loudly so both of them hear him):
  <span class="quote speech">A lot.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You shut up!</span> shouts the official from
  inside.<br />
  The driver says, talking over his shoulder:
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m inclined to agree with him.</span>
  <br />
  Then, he turns around and walks to the end of the first railcar where he
  proceeds to detach the hoses and cables and unhooks the couplings.
  He returns to the front and climbs back inside.
</p>
<p>
  The headlights come back on and a few contactors click inside the train.
  A compressor kicks into action. After a moment, the door closes.
  The train sits like this for a few minutes until the compressor turns off
  again. Jack shoves a handfull of chips into his mouth. The inner door
  of the airlock begins to open, creaking and buzzing as it slowly moves
  up.
</p>
<p>
  The motors begin to hum and the first car of the train starts moving
  towards the airlock. It loses power as it rolls past the end of the power
  rail and over the switches. The headlights dim. Jack shoves another
  handful of chips into his mouth. The railcar disappears completely inside
  the airlock, rolling without power. It&apos;s still decently far away
  from the other door. Jack thinks <span class="quote non-speech">any
  second now...</span> as he waits for the emergency brakes to engage.
  The car rolls deeper into the airlock, beyond Jack&apos;s view. Moments
  later, loud hissing sounds from inside the airlock as the train&apos;s
  failsafe mechanism trips, followed by screeching and grinding noises from
  the brakes.
</p>
<p>
  Jack grabs his bag of chips and gets up. He walks onto the tracks and
  looks into the airlock, stuffing his face as he watches the dim
  <span class="comment">R&uuml;cklichter? rear lights?</span> go out.
  A few minutes pass and nothing happens. Eventually, he hears one of
  the doors getting unlocked with a key and sees a hand pushing it open.
  He gets off the track and sits back down next to the rails,
  continuing to crunch on chips. A bit later, the driver and the railway
  official emerge from the tunnel, the latter seeming pretty close
  to having an aneurysm.<br />
  Jack says: <span class="quote speech">Told you so.</span><br />
  The railway official loses it completely, <span class="comment">stampfen?
  </span> and jumping around while screaming some presumably very colorful
  language &ndash; Jack doesn&apos;t understand a single word.
</p>
<p>
  The train driver approaches him: <span class="quote speech">
  Who are you, by the way, and what are you doing around the tracks?
  </span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Jack, former head of dome infra between
  1992 and 1994.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You look like you&apos;re twenty-something,
  not over a hundred.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I was frozen after that.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, you seem to know some things about
  trains. You <span class="comment">reckon</span> we can get that thing
  towed out with an <span class="comment">translate: &Uuml;berl&auml;nge
  </span> train?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;d say it&apos;s probably not
  advisable. It could work, but you should really just use a diesel
  locomotive.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Diesel?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">My bad &mdash; battery-powered.
  Alternatively, I can get the diesel-electric train from outside and
  push it back in.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You have a train that is perfectly fine going
  on unpowered track and let us get one of ours stuck in there?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Told him.</span> Jack nods towards the railway
  official. <span class="quote speech">He didn&apos;t wanna hear about
  it.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="comment">
  missing section: they decide to have Jack get the train from IV South
</p>
<p>
  Jack grabs the microphone off the wall and holds the push to talk button
  on the control panel in front of him.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">7-oh-5-D oh-oh-1-4, underway to
  airlock two. Control, permission to enter Sunside cove?</span><br />
  He waits for a moment. Noise from the speaker, but no discernable
  response.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">This is train 7-oh-5-D oh-oh-1-4, approaching
  airlock two. Control, do I have permission to enter?</span><br />
  <!--
  Control: 705E... 705D 0014 your track is blocked by another train. Stop immediately.
  short pause, Jack decelerates
  Control: 705E 0151 what's your situation?
  705E 0151: Control, waiting for 705D 0014 to push us back out of the airlock
  Control: 705D 0014 you are ok to enter, proceed with caution

  more missing section

  they decide the best course for Sunside Cove is to convert a 705E to 705D
  with parts harvested from the IV train yard
