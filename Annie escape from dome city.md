A train is coming. As Annie reaches the platform, she hears the sirens of the police cars coming closer. They are really close now. The first police car arrives at the station at the same time as the train arrives at the platform. Annie stands still as she panics. Where could she go?

"Annie!" Someone shouts her name. "Annie, come here, run!"

She looks up. The train turned out to be a single car. A single, very rusty car. Annie starts to move. Inside is a single person, the driver, running to the other end. He wears a CryoCorp jacket - no doubt, that has to be Jack. She runs towards the closest door. The humming of the motors getting energized begins to sound. Annie jumps inside as the railcar starts moving in the direction it came from. The doors close as it leaves the platform.

The train accelerates with a force stronger than anything she has ever felt before. The motors scream, the wind rattles at the doors. While she makes her way to the front, Annie looks outside. The city flies by. The horn sounds as the train barrels though a station. The platform appears, is visible for just enough time to see the astonished faces of the onlookers, and disappears again.

She reaches the driver’s cabin.  
"Hello Jack!"  
"Hi"  
"I have never seen one of these go this fast."  
"Me neither."  
Short pause.

Jack adds: "I mean there used to be trains that could go faster - a lot faster - but not these."  
"You arrived just in time, we got really lucky."  
Jack looks at the rails in front of the train with a slightly worried look on his face. After another short pause, he says "That remains to be seen. Cycling that airlock seems to have set off some sort of alarm. Like poking a stick into an anthill..."  
"An anthill?"  
"Oh, I forgot, you wouldn’t know... Ants are tiny little animals. They tend to pile up loose material from the ground into small hills as their nests. If you poke a stick into one, they scramble to defend it."  
"Ah..."

*Note to self: This dialog needs to be continued to tie the sections together*

Jack decelerates the train. "Almost there", he says. They are driving towards the outer wall of the dome. The ‘B33FY-AF’ door on the inside of the airlock is wide open. Technicians and police are standing around it in groups trying to figure out why it had opened. The ramps leading up to the rails and the airlock are full of parked transporters and police cars. Some are even on the rails but the track that Annie and Jack are approaching on is mostly clear.

The train loses power and passes over a bunch of switches. The headlights flicker and turn off. A police car that is standing too close to the track gets flung to the side. A bunch of technicians jump out of the way. The train passes them and rolls into the airlock. Everything ahead of them is black. The only thing that is visible are the illuminated gauges on the control panel.

*This is missing some explanation as to why the police don’t immediately intervene. Also, the train comes to a stop in the airlock - it has to - so there should be something about that.*

"Cycling airlock, please stand by", announces an automated voice. The bunker door closes behind them with a screeching noise. They hear loud hissing noises. Then, the (currently invisible) bunker door in front of them opens up.

The train shakes slightly as it makes a noise that sounds like a mechanical version of someone clearing their throat. The gauges on the control panel flicker slightly. Annie is surprised by this, the noise is unfamiliar to her. It turns into a constant humming and the headlights come on again. The beams of light reveal a long tunnel with a slight incline ahead.

"You look puzzled." Jack looks at Annie.  
"What’s this weird noise?"  
"Out here, there are no power rails so the train has to generate its own power. That’s the engine of the generator. Speaking of being ‘out here’... We made it."

*Appropriate reaction? Idk. Am bad at writing dialog. Will revisit.*

"In about two minutes, it is going to get very bright." Jack says while setting the train in motion again. "Close your eyes if it gets too bright for you. It might take a while to get used to daylight."  
As the train starts moving up the incline, an automated voice comes on: "Dear passengers! Welcome to the outside world! The next stop is <station name>. Please take some time to let your eyes adjust to the light before stepping on the platform. The train will wait there for five minutes. Enjoy your travel."

The train leans into a curve. After a moment, a blue-ish white shimmer becomes visible on the tunnel walls. It gets brighter and brighter. The train reaches the end of the curve. The other end of the tunnel comes into sight. It’s really bright. Brighter than a hundred spotlights shining on the same spot. Annie closes her eyes but the light continues getting brighter. She covers her eyes with her hands.

The automated voice comes on again: "We are now approaching <station name>. Your next connections are <list of five lines with departure times>. This train will continue on line 5 to <ruined city name> via <two or three other important stops>."  
"I wish...", says Jack. "I wonder how much of it is still standing."  
*some reply from Annie Idk*

Annie hears Jack removing a key from the control panel. The hum of the motors stops, the generator turns off, and the train starts slowing down. She tries to squint but it’s still too bright.  
"I think you could use a pair of sunglasses."  
"Sunglasses?"  
"They’re like normal glasses but... dark. To make bright light easier on your eyes."  
Jack puts a pair of sunglasses in Annie’s hands. She puts them on and cautiously squints outside. They are just rolling into a station.

*At this point should be some marker to indicate the end of a section - beginning of a new chapter or something like that - but the next section should probably be Annie’s first impressions of the outside world so I’m adding it here*

The station is is much larger than any of the metro stations inside the dome. It has many platforms. Portions of the tall roof that is supported by long pillars have caved in and what’s still standing has holes. Rays of light poke through holes in the wall ahead, and some of the holes in the roof, landing on the wall to the left. All of that looks impressive but what really catches her eyes are the plants everywhere. Parts of the platforms are densely covered in the thin blades of some plant giving them a fuzzy look. Unfamiliar vines cling to the walls and pillars, crawl along gaps and edges, and hang from rusty beams and the fringes of the caved in roof sections. Moss grows on the rusted benches and trash cans.

The train drives over a bunch of bushes and tall flowers that have taken root on the tracks. Jack brings it to a stop towards the end of the station.  
"Exit to the right in the direction of travel", he says in unison with the automated voice. He turns a switch and the doors open with a squeaking sound. Then, he turns to Annie:  
"After you." Jack nods towards the passenger area.

Jack and Annie step out onto the platform. Annie breathes the warm air. It smells of plants. Insects are buzzing about, and the wind rustles through the leaves of plants.
