<h1>
  Night Watch
</h1>
<p>
  There&apos;s the station. Michelle looks up at the clock. 06:41.
  The morning twilight gives the sky a pink hue.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Shit! Two minutes.</span><br />
  She runs for the platform. Warm air hits her face as she enters the
  station &ndash; and the all too familiar stench of piss. She looks up at
  the signs. Something is off but she can&apos;t quite tell what.
  She runs along, looking for her platform, until she reaches the other
  end of the tunnel.<br />
  It hits her: <span class="quote non-speech">Wait...
  Where the fuck is platform 6?</span><br />
  She runs back. Platform 6 is nowhere to be seen. Someone grabs her by
  the shoulder.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle?</span><br />
  She opens her eyes and lifts her head, looking around in confusion.
  It&apos;s dark. A tiny bit of flickering light illuminates the room
  around her. Jack leans forward and sets a lantern with a candle on the
  table.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you wanna sleep in your bed?
  Your body would thank you.</span><br />
  She remembers. She was supposed to be on night watch until two.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">What time is it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Three AM.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sorry.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">All good, nothing happened.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What about the fire?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Still embers.</span><br />
  She stands up, holding onto the table with one hand and moving her hair
  out of her face with the other. She thinks
  <span class="quote non-speech">When did I fall asleep?</span>
  Last thing she remembers, it was still bright outside.
  <span class="quote non-speech">8 PM? No, it's June. 9 PM?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">something has to be said here, dialog/paragraph
  feels unfinished</span>
</p>
<p>
  Wolves howling outside get their attention. Michelle suddenly feels very
  awake. Jack grabs a gun and checks that it is loaded. Michelle grabs her
  bow and quiver with arrows. They walk over to the entrance and look
  around. It&apos;s still dark, but barely bright enough to see. The sky
  over the mountain ridge to the north-east is a faint green, the rest is
  deep blue and some stars are visible. A pack of wolves is down by the
  river, minding their own business. The two watch the wolves for a while
  before concluding they probably aren&apos;t a concern for now. Jack puts
  the gun into the <span class="comment">holster?</span> on his belt and
  Michelle lays bow and quiver down and sits next to the embers.
</p>
<p>
  She grabs a few sticks of dry fir, needles still attached, and pushes
  them into the embers. After a bit of blowing on them, they go up in
  flames. Jack dumps a pile of dry fir and other sticks on it and they
  both blow on the flames.

  the fire.</span>
