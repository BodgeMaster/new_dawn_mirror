<h1>
  Night Watch
</h1>
<!-- perspective: Michelle -->
<p>
  There&apos;s the station. Michelle looks up. The morning twilight gives
  the sky a pink hue. The station&apos;s clock shows&nbsp;06:41.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Shit! Two minutes.</span><br />
  She begins running for the platform. Warm air hits her face as she enters
  the station &ndash; and the all too familiar stench of piss. She looks at
  the signs. Something&apos;s off but she can&apos;t quite tell what.
  She runs along, looking for her platform, until she reaches the other
  end of the tunnel.<br />
  It hits her: <span class="quote non-speech">Wait...
  Where the hell is platform 6?</span><br />
  She runs back. Platform 6 is nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>
  Someone grabs her by the shoulder.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle?</span><br />
  She opens her eyes and lifts her head, looking around in confusion.
  It&apos;s dark. A tiny bit of flickering light illuminates the room
  around her. Jack leans forward and sets a lantern with a candle on the
  table.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you wanna sleep in your bed?
  Your body would appreciate it.</span><br />
  She remembers. She was supposed to be on night watch until two.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">What time is it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Three A.M.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sorry.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">All good, nothing happened.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What about the fire?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Still embers.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Phew.</span><br />
  She stands up, holding on to the table for support with one hand while
  moving her hair out of her face with the other. She thinks
  <span class="quote non-speech">When did I fall asleep?</span>
  Last thing she remembers, it was still bright outside.
  <span class="quote non-speech">8 P.M.? No, it's June. 9 P.M.?</span>
  She yawns.
</p>
<p>
  Their attention gets abruptly captured by wolves howling. Michelle
  suddenly feels very awake. Jack grabs a gun from the safe and checks
  that it is loaded. Michelle opens a drawer and grabs her bow and quiver
  with arrows. They walk over to the entrance and look around. It&apos;s
  still dark outside, but barely bright enough to see. The sky over the
  mountain ridge to the north-east is a faint green, the rest is deep blue
  with stars. A pack of wolves is down by the river, minding their own
  business. The two watch them for a while before concluding they probably
  aren&apos;t a concern for now. Jack puts the gun into the
  <span class="comment">holster?</span> on his belt and Michelle lays
  bow and quiver down and sits by the embers.
</p>
<p>
  She grabs a few sticks of dry fir, needles still attached, and pushes
  them into the embers. After a bit of blowing on them, they go up in
  flames. Jack dumps another pile of fir and other sticks onto it and they
  both blow on the flames.
</p>
<p>
  Soon enough, the fire is back in its full form. Jack goes inside and
  reemerges with two <span class="comment">seat cushions?</span>,
  blankets, and some snacks. They sit down next to
  each other on the cushions on the ground, facing the fire.
  Michelle feels her back getting cold and puts one of the blankets over
  her shoulders. Jack seems to have other priorities &ndash; he opens
  a preserved can of cashews and starts munching. She grabs a handful
  and starts eating as well, staring into the warm glow of the flames.
  The heat that starts radiating from the fire fills her body with a fuzzy
  warmth.
</p>
<p>
  She wakes up to find herself laying on her side, still facing the fire,
  with her head on Jack&apos;s lap. She feels him twirling her hair through
  his fingers. Everything around them is bright as day.<br />
  She says: <span class="quote speech">I didn&apos;t know we were close
  like that.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sorry.</span> He stops.
  <span class="quote speech">I don&apos;t think we are. You were just very
  out of it.</span><br />
  Michelle adjusts her pose, moving the arm she is laying on to a more
  comfortable position, but stays put.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m fine with this. We can cringe about
  it later... By the way, what time is it?</span><br />
  Jack looks at his watch. She hears the segments of the metal
  <span class="comment">wrist band?</span> moving near her ear.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Around 04:30 A.M.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, good night.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">Thank you to PineappleJoy for the inspiration
  for this wonderful dialog. :)<br />
  I&apos;m not sure if I should keep it though, because this isn&apos;t
  gonna go anywhere.</span>
  <!--
    Jack&apos;s reaction could possibly be modified to be explicitly
    non-romantic.

    Or break the fourth wall and say:
      "Editor's note: Yup, they cringed about it."
    I would rather not do that though, at least not without it being a
    <span class="comment"> which is not part of the story.
