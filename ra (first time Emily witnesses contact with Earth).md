*Outline:*

* *Emily walks to the main control center* 
  * *it has also been used as a general hang-out spot bc it has a rather nice view of the biotope and the sky*
* *Emily and Lena sit down at a desk with a view of the biotope and have a meal*
  * *the meal gets interrupted by the equipment in the control center coming to life (fans coming on, some control panels lighting up, boot-up/status/ready beeps)*
    * *a status light on the wall, that Emily had never seen on, lights up (could be something like "LINK")*
    * *short dialog, could be something like this: "That’s them." "Earth people?" Lena nods and gets up.*
* *Lena tells Emily to follow*
  * *They walk over to a control panel with an embedded terminal*
  * *Communication with Earth ensues*
    * *bittersweet dialog*
      * *Emily is conscious again*
      * *Lena is going to die*
      * *They talk about what will become of Emily*
        * *Emily doesn’t (yet) want to leave the moon - she’s afraid of leaving her entire world behind*
        * *The decision is made that whatever preparations can be done, should be done, just in case*
