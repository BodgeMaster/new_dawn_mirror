<h1> Basic Needs</h1>
<p>
  Jack drives into a dried-out river. In the distance on the other side is
  a group of houses that, while they have certainly seen better days,
  don&apos;t look abandoned. The truck struggles to get traction in the
  sand on the other side of the river and eventually gets stuck.
  <span class="quote speech">Well fuck.</span> Jack backs up and turns
  into the river. He accelerates, then steers back onto the river bank
  &ndash; to no avail, the truck gets stuck again. He turns back into the
  river. The engine roars. First gear, second gear, third gear...
</p>
<p>
  The suspension bottoms out as the truck plows uphill through the sand,
  barely making it out of the river. Annie holds her shoulder, it hurts
  from getting pushed into the seat belt.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Can we not do that again, please?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">response?</span><br />
  Jack turns around and drives onto the overgrown remains of a road leading
  to the settlement.
</p>
<p>
  He parks in front of an old store.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">This is it, I guess.</span><br />
  They get out and start walking towards the door. A small dog runs up to
  them, barking, jumping around, running in circles, and wagging its tail.
  It picks up a stick and drops it in front of Annie. She crouches down,
  pets the dog, and picks up the stick.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;ll be right there</span>, Annie says
  to Jack before throwing it.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay.</span> Jack goes into the store.
</p>
<p>
  After playing fetch for a bit, Annie follows. Behind the counter is a man
  who appears to be in his 60s. He is talking to Jack:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I mean in the long run. We have plenty of food
  right now but, since the &lt;river name&gt; has changed course, we
  don&apos;t even have enough water to grow crops for ourselves. The
  cisterns and wells simply don&apos;t cut it.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So, basically, you&apos;re saying you need
  water.</span><br />
  The man interrupts the conversation and looks at Annie:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Good afternoon, what can I do for you?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m with him.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see.</span><br />
  He turns back to Jack:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Listen, we don&apos;t just need a little bit of
  water. The amount of water we need can&apos;t simply be carried here or
  we&apos;d do it ourselves. And we need it regularly and consistently.
  When the &lt;river&gt; still flowed here, water used to flow into our
  irrigation system upstream and got distributed to all the fields and
  greenhouses from there.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I know you need an industrial quantity of
  water. We can get you an industrial quantity of water. Will you give us
  food if we supply you?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">&quot;Who is *we*?&quot;</span><br />
  He musters Jack for a moment.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">And how do you wanna get it here?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">By train - assuming the railroad south of here
  is in a serviceable state.</span> Seeing the man&apos;s confusion, Jack
  adds: <span class="quote speech">Let that be my problem to solve. Will
  you trade water for food?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m gonna have to discuss that with the
  others. Wait outside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After playing with the dog some more, they get approached by a group of
  people, amongst them the man from the store. They shake hands. Jack
  repeats his idea to supply water by train in exchange for crops.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What&apos;s this train you&apos;re talking
  of?</span>, one of them asks.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">A large vehicle from the old world. It drives
  on tracks like the ones that should be south of here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So that&apos;s what these rails were used
  for... But that&apos;s still pretty far from here, how do you wanna
  transport the water here?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">That irrigation system of yours... Can we take
  a look at it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see where you&apos;re trying to go with
  this. It&apos;s still not particularly close to the rails.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After a bit of additional back and forth, they agree on a plan. The man
  who did most of the talking asks a girl:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Mary, can you go, show them around?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Sure, follow me.</span>
  <span class="comment">It&apos;s a bit of a walk...</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Wait</span>, Jack stops her,
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re here with a truck.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So that&apos;s <i>your</i> car? Cool!
  I&apos;ve only ever seen one working car in the city. So we&apos;re
  gonna drive there?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">If you show us the way.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Let&apos;s go!</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Not sure of this should be the end of a chapter or if I should continue
  here. The way this has turned out, it would also be nice if they ended up
  delivering construction machines (excavators, etc.) to the village so
  they don&apos;t need to rely on water shipments past the day when the
  protagonists leave for Nova Metropolis.
