</ul>
<p>
  <span class="speech">Next stop: Central Square</span><br />
  Annie looks up. That&apos;s the station she has to get off at. She only
  needs to be at work in the afternoon so she decided to get the manual for
  Jack.
</p>
<p>
  The train comes to a halt in the station. Annie steps out onto the
  platform. Few people are around at this time. She glances at the clock
  next to the train display: 10:17 AM. The light on the display switches to
  the next train and the digits for the time of arrival start flipping over.
  <span class="comment"> Is there a more elegant way to describe the train
  station displays of yesteryear? </span> The door chime sounds and the
  doors close. Annie starts to walk. The train begins to hum and starts to
  move. She follows the roughly three other people towards the exit.
</p>
<p>
  Annie walks down the stairs and steps onto the square. It is brightly
  illuminated by a large glowing sphere made of yellow and brown glass
  tiles suspended on steel cables hanging from four office complexes that
  tower over the rest of the buildings. To the right is the library, a
  large building with a facade of sandstone blocks. The front features
  large pillars and a staircase spanning the entire width of the building
  making it look like an ancient temple. The wall behind the pillars has
  multiple rows of windows revealing that the building has multiple stories.
</p>
<p>
  Annie makes her way up the stairs and enters through the large wooden
  doors. She walks up to the counter. <br />
  <span class="speech">Hello, how may I help you today?</span><br />
  The guy behind the counter smiles.<br />
  <span class="speech">Borrowing the next stack of fantasy books?</span>,
  he asks. <br />
  <span class="speech">Uhm... Actually, no</span>, Annie replies as she
  takes her library card and a piece of paper out of her bag.<br />
  <span class="speech">I have a quite unusual request. I am looking
  for</span> - she glances at the piece of paper - <span class="speech">a
  manual for a B three three F Y dash A F bunker door.</span><br />
  The guy types into his terminal for a moment. Annie places her library
  card on the counter. With a worried look, he turns back to her: <br />
  <span class="speech">I&apos;m afraid, that information has recently been
  classified. There is a note about terrorism in here.</span><br />
  <span class="speech">So there is no way to get it?</span><br />
  He musters her for a second, then he takes the card and scribbles
  something on it before putting it back. <br />
  <span class="speech">I can check you against a list of people with
  security clearance. One moment, I&apos;ll get it.</span><br />
  He gestures and nods towards the exit. Then, he turns around and walks
  towards a door on the left, seemingly taking his sweet time. Annie gets
  the message, grabs her library card and makes a swift exit. Just as she
  leaves, she hears him call out to someone else: <br />
  <span class="speech">Dorothy, she left. What do I put on the list?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="comment"> Input on how to format this dialog is appreciated.
  </span><br />
  <span class="comment"> heavy door falls shut, Annie hurries back to the
  train station and gets on the first train that comes, she takes out her
  library card and checks the note - such and such station, 10:30 PM
  </span>
