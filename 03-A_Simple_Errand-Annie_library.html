<h1> A Simple Errand</h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Next stop: Central Square</span><br />
  Annie looks up. That&apos;s where she has to get off. She only needs to
  be at work in the afternoon so she decided to get that manual for Jack.
</p>
<p>
  The train comes to a halt in the station. Annie steps out onto the
  platform. Few people are around at this time. She glances at the clock
  next to the train display: 10:17 AM. The light on the display switches to
  the next train and the digits for the time of arrival start flipping over.
  <span class="comment"> Is there a more elegant way to describe the train
  station displays of yesteryear? </span> The door chime sounds and the
  doors close. Annie starts to walk. The train begins to hum and starts to
  move. She follows the roughly three other people towards the exit.
</p>
<p>
  Annie walks down the stairs and steps onto the square. It is brightly
  illuminated by a large glowing sphere made of yellow and brown glass
  tiles, suspended on steel cables that hang from four office complexes
  at the corners of the square, towering over the rest of the buildings.
  The other buildings around the square are more in line with the rest of
  the city but they each have a very unique look. There&apos;s the town
  hall <span class="comment"> city hall?</span>, a building of dark red
  and yellow bricks, arranged to form beautiful patterns. Next to it is
  the Museum of the Last Days, a dystopian-looking building with black
  metal plates as a facade. Other buildings of note include the courthouse,
  a theater, <span class="comment">Does that word also apply to what the
  German word means?</span> and the cathedral - the only religious building
  in the city.
</p>
<p>
  To her right is the library, a large building with a facade of sandstone
  blocks. The front features large pillars and a staircase spanning the
  entire width of the building giving it the look of an ancient temple.
  The wall behind the pillars has multiple rows of windows.
</p>
<p>
  Annie makes her way up the stairs and enters through the large wooden
  doors. She walks up to the counter. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Hello, how may I help you today?</span> The guy
  behind the counter smiles. <span class="quote speech">Borrowing the next
  stack of fantasy books?</span>, he asks. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Uhm... Actually, no</span>, Annie replies as
  she takes her library card and a piece of paper out of her bag.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I have a quite unusual request. I am looking
  for</span> &ndash; she glances at the piece of paper &ndash;
  <span class="quote speech">a manual for a Neotek B three three F Y dash
  A F bunker door.</span><br />
  The guy types into his terminal for a moment. Annie places her library
  card on the counter. With a worried look, he turns back to her: <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m afraid, that it has recently been
  classified. There is a note about terrorism in here.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">So there is no way to get it?</span><br />
  He musters her for a second, then he takes the card, quickly scribbles
  something on it, and puts it back. <br />
  <span class="quote speech">I can check you against a list of people with
  security clearance. One moment, I&apos;ll get it.</span><br />
  He gestures towards the exit. Then, he turns around and walks towards a
  door to the left, seemingly taking his sweet time. Annie gets the
  message, grabs her library card and makes a swift exit. Just as she
  leaves, she hears him call out to someone else: <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Dorothy, she left. What do I put on the
  list?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="comment"> Input on how to format this dialog is appreciated.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Annie is already half-way down the stairs by the time the heavy door
  falls shut. Quickly, she walks back to the station. A train is coming.
  She hurries up the stairs and gets on. The doors close and it begins to
  move. Annie catches her breath and takes her library card out to look at
  it. The note written on it reads:
  <span class="quote non-speech">&lt;metro station&gt; 10:30PM
  tonight</span>.
