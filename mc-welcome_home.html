<h1>Welcome Home</h1>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I smell fire.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">We&apos;re almost there.</span><br />
  Annie is slightly confused by his answer and how seemingly unfazed he is.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you want to do something about
  it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Fires out here aren&apos;t all bad news.
  Some are, but I&apos;m gonna guess this one&apos;s our campfire.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Annie and Jack walk over a ridge, revealing a view of the small valley
  beyond. The large, open bunker door is visible on the other side,
  with bushes to the left and right and an open area in front of it that
  connects to an old, partially overgrown street. A person is sitting
  next to a fire right in front of the door, cooking over the flames.<br />
  <span class="comment">Is there a word for a terrain feature like a very
  small valley?</span>
</p>
<p>
  They make their way across and Jack introduces Michelle and Annie to each
  other.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So you join us out here after all?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yeah, things kinda went south quickly.</span>
  </br />
  They all sit down around the fire and Annie recounts the events of the
  recent past while the meal continues cooking.
</p>
<p>
  A noise in the bushes around the bunker entrance gets their attention.
  Michelle tilts her head, then turns around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is that a dog? There&apos;s a dog here!</span>
  <br />
  A medium-sized, brown dog runs out, barks and then runs back into the
  bushes. A moment later, it reappears, followed by a guy wearing a long,
  dark green coat that has been patched a few times. He holds a long staff,
  using it as a <span class="comment">Wanderstab? Cane?</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Good evening!</span><br />
  They greet the stranger back and Michelle and Jack invite him to stay.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gladly.</span> He comes closer.
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m James, the green wizard of
  Siren&apos;s&nbsp;Edge.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, time traveller. Can you show us
  some of your magic?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, currently no, my staff is broken.</span>
  He swings it around and makes some funny noises.
  <span class="quote speech">See? Not working.</span><br />
  They all have a laugh and Annie and Jack introduce themselves in a more
  normal manner. Michelle asks:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">What leads you to the area?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I am searching for... &emsp;&emsp; Dora!
  C&apos;mere, sit!</span><br />
  The dog stops sniffing the pots over the fire and returns to James.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As I was saying, I am looking for pictures
  from the old world like this one...</span><br />
  He shows an old, crumpled photo that, while faded and discolored, still
  clearly depicts a nebula and some stars.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... and maybe the means to take them.
  I heard there is a quite well-preserved observatory near
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">This is a new lead for Michelle and Jack.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Michelle takes the pots off the fire and Jack gets dishes from inside
  the bunker.<br />
  (Some of) The food is unfamiliar to Annie.<br />
  While eating, they discuss their mission.
