<h1>Welcome Home</h1>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I smell fire.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes, we&apos;re almost there.</span><br />
  Annie is slightly confused by his answer and how seemingly unfazed he is.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you want to do something about
  it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Fires out here aren&apos;t all bad news.
  Sometimes, they are, but I&apos;m gonna guess this one&apos;s our
  campfire.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They walk over a ridge, revealing a view of the small valley beyond.
  The large, open bunker door is visible on the other side, in front of it
  a small fire with a person sitting next to it.<br />
  <span class="comment">Is there a word for a terrain feature like a valley
  but a lot smaller?</span>
</p>
<p>
  They make their way across and Jack introduces Michelle and Annie to each
  other.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So you join us out here after all?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Things kinda went south quickly.</span></br />
  They all sit down around the fire and Annie recounts the events of the
  recent past. <span class="comment">Idk, something needs
  to happen here. They start making food or whatever.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Michelle tilts her head, then turns around. <span class="quote speech">Is
  that a dog? There&apos;s a dog here!</span><br />
  A medium-sized dog runs out of the bushes, barks and then turns around
  and runs back. A moment latrer, it reappears, followed by an
  <span class="comment">unkempt?</span> dude wearing a long coat
  that has been patched a couple times. He holds a long staff, using it as
  a <span class="comment">Wanderstab?</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Good evening, people!</span>
  <span class="comment">realistic?</span><br />
  Michelle replies: <span class="quote speech">Evening.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Dora, sit!</span><br />
  The others greet the stranger as well. He asks for directions to the
  Sentinel Shores observatory.<br />
