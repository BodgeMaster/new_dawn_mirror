<h1>Welcome Home</h1>
<!-- perspective: Annie -->

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I smell fire.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yup, we&apos;re almost there.</span><br />
  Annie is slightly confused by his answer and how seemingly unfazed he is.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you want to do something about
  it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gonna guess that&apos;s our campfire &ndash;
  nothing to worry about.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I hope you're right on that.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  lay of the land info (for Jack opening the door scene):<br />
  from their current PoV, there is a road below them, coming from
  the right, crossing the the valley over a bridge, and turning back
  to the right where it passes the bunker and continues around the other
  mountain<br />
  Maybe, since this is Annie&apos;s perspective, it might be fitting
  to lay it out again.
</p>
<p>
  Annie and Jack walk over a ridge, revealing a view of the small valley
  beyond. The bunker is set into the mountain on the other side, the large
  open door visible from afar. There is a small cleared space between it
  and the road, surrounded by bushes. Someone is sitting there, next to
  a fire. They start making their way down to the road.<br />
  Jack takes a radio off his belt and speaks into it:
  <span class="comment">research todo: radio protocol</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, we&apos;re just entering the
  valley.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">We? You got company?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see. I&apos;m cooking &ndash; any food
  allergies or other dietary restrictions I should watch out for?</span>
  <br />
  Annie shakes her head.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">She says no.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, see you in a bit.</span><br />
  Jack puts the radio away and the two continue downwards.
</p>
<p>
  It takes them a while to get to the road. The pavement is cracked with
  plants growing out of it. Ahead of them is a bridge over a small river.
  They cross it about half-way where Annie stops and turns to the railing.
  She almost leans against it, before a thought shoots into her mind:
  <span class="quote non-speech">What if it breaks?</span>
  She grabs on to it and shakes ... herself. The railing stands firm.
</p>
<p>
  Jack joins her, looking down at what&apos;s below, and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Learning quickly, huh?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Seeing it once is good enough.</span><br />
  A small stream flows there, cutting deep into the ground, lined by
  a thicket of bushes on either side.<br />
  Jack asks: <span class="quote speech">Are you familiar with
  raspberries?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">They are very rare and expensive.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Look over there.</span><br />
  He points to one of the bushes which, on a second look, is full of
  berries.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ooooh!</span><br />
  They walk to the other side of the bridge and go to the bush.<br />
  After picking a few berries, Jack says:
  <span class="quote speech">I think we should come back later with
  a bucket.</span><br />
  Annie agrees and they make their way through the bushes to the stream,
  where they wash and eat the berries.
  <br />
  <span class="comment">Note to self: At some point soon-ish after this,
  Annie will try testing the railing on a bridge or building and the floor
  under her feet will give out. From then on, she will be afraid of
  going too close to railings / edges.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
  They continue along the road. It makes a sharp turn to the right into
  a slight incline along the hillside. They walk for a few more minutes
  and reach the bunker. As they approach, the person they saw earlier
  &ndash; presumably Michelle &ndash; comes out of the bunker and adds
  some ingredients to a pot on a tripod over the flames.
  Jack introduces the two to each other &ndash; it <i>is</i> Michelle.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">So you join us out here after all?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yeah, things went south kinda quickly.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well then, welcome to your new home for the
  time being.</span><br />
  They all sit down around the fire and Annie recounts the events of the
  recent past while the meal continues cooking.
</p>
<p>
  The ensuing conversation is interrupted by a noise in the bushes around
  them. Michelle tilts her head, then turns around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is that a dog? There&apos;s a dog here!</span>
  <br />
  A medium-sized, brown dog runs out, sniffs them all, barks and then runs
  off on the road, disappearing around a rock outcrop. A moment later, it
  comes back, followed by a guy wearing a long, dark green coat that has
  been patched a few times. He is wearing a backpack and holds a long
  staff, using it as a walking stick.
</p>
<p>
  The stranger says: <span class="quote speech">Good evening!</span><br />
  They greet him back and Michelle and Jack invite him to join them around
  the fire.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gladly.</span> He comes closer.
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m James, the green wizard of
  Siren&apos;s&nbsp;Edge.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, time traveling witch. Show us some
  of your magic, wizard.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, unfortunately, my staff is broken.</span>
  <br />
  He swings it around and makes some funny noises.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">See? Not working.</span><br />
  They all have a laugh and Annie and Jack introduce themselves in a more
  normal manner.<br />
  Michelle asks:
  <span class="quote speech">What leads you to the area?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I am searching for... &emsp;&emsp; Dora!
  C&apos;mere, sit!</span><br />
  The dog stops sniffing the pot over the fire and returns to James.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As I was saying, I am looking for pictures
  from the old world like this one...</span><br />
  He shows an old, crumpled photo that, while faded and discolored, still
  clearly depicts a nebula and some stars.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... and maybe the means to take them.
  I heard there is a quite well-preserved observatory near
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">This is a new lead for Michelle and Jack.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Michelle takes the pot off the fire and Jack gets dishes from inside
  the bunker.<br />
  (Some of) The food is unfamiliar to Annie.<br />
  While eating, they discuss their mission.
