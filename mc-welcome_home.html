<p class="comment">
  Annie and Jack arrive at the bunker.
  Annie smells fire and is worried by that -> fire in dome city is always
  a bad sign.
  Michelle and Annie get introduced.
  James shows up?
</p>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I smell fire.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yes, we&apos;re very close now.</span><br />
  Annie is slightly confused by his answer and how seemingly
  <span class="comment">unfazed? Is that how you spell it?</span> he is.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">But ... Don&apos;t you want to do anything
  about it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Fires out here aren&apos;t generally bad news.
  Sometimes, they are, but this one is our campfire.</span>
</p>
<p>
  They walk over a <span class="comment">Grat? Ausl&auml;ufer?</span>,
  revealing a view of the small valley beyond. The large, open bunker door
  is visible on the other side, in front of it a small fire with a person
  sitting next to it.
