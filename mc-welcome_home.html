<h1>Welcome Home</h1>

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I smell fire.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yup, we&apos;re almost there.</span><br />
  Annie is slightly confused by his answer and how seemingly unfazed he is.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Don&apos;t you want to do something about
  it?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gonna guess that&apos;s our campfire &ndash;
  nothing to worry about.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">response?</span>
</p>
<p>
  Annie and Jack walk over a <span class="comment">crest? ridge?</span>,
  revealing a view of the small valley beyond.
  <span class="comment">Is there a distinct word for a terrain feature
  like a very small valley?</span><br />
  The bunker is set into the mountain on the other side, the large open
  door visible from afar. There is a small cleared space between it and
  the road, surrounded by bushes. Someone is sitting there, next to
  a fire.<br />
  <span class="comment">lay of the land info (for Jack opening the door
  scene): from their current PoV, there is a road below them, coming from
  the right, crossing the the valley over a bridge, and turning back
  to the right where it passes the bunker and continues around the other
  mountain</span><br />
  They start making their way down to the road.<br />
  Jack takes a radio off his belt and speaks into it:
  <span class="comment">research todo: radio protocol</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, we&apos;re just entering the
  valley.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">We? Someone came along?</span><br />
  <span class="comment">wording? translate: mitgekommen</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Annie.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I see. Am cooking &ndash; any food allergies
  or other dietary restrictions I should watch out for?</span><br />
  Annie shakes her head.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">She says no.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, see you in a bit.</span><br />
  Jack puts the radio away and the two continue downwards.
</p>
<p>
  It takes them a while to get to the road. The pavement is cracked with
  plants growing out of it. Ahead of them is a bridge over a small river.
  They cross it about half-way where Annie stops and turns to the railing.
  She almost leans against it, before the thought
  <span class="quote non-speech">What if it breaks?</span> shoots into her
  head. She grabs on to it and shakes ... herself. The railing stands firm.
  <br />
  <span class="comment">At some point soon-ish after this, Annie will try
  this and the floor under her will give out. From then on, she will be
  afraid of going too close to railings / edges.</span><br />
  Jack joins her looking down at the small river below and says:
  <span class="quote speech">Learning quickly, huh?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech"></span>
  <span class="comment">What she got to say? What she seeing?</span>
</p>
<p>
  After a moment, they continue along the road. It makes a sharp turn to
  the right into a slight incline along the hillside. They walk for a few
  more minutes and reach the bunker. As they approach, the person they saw
  earlier &ndash; presumably Michelle &ndash; comes out of the bunker and
  adds some ingredients to a pot on a tripod over the flames.
  <span class="comment">Is there a word for these metal rings with three
  legs?</span>
  Jack introduces the two to each other &ndash; it <i>is</i> Michelle.
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">So you join us out here after all?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Yeah, things kinda went south quickly.</span>
  </br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well then, welcome to your new home for the
  time being.</span>
  They all sit down around the fire and Annie recounts the events of the
  recent past while the meal continues cooking.
</p>
<p>
  The ensuing conversation is interrupted by a noise in the bushes.
  Michelle tilts her head, then turns around.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Is that a dog? There&apos;s a dog here!</span>
  <br />
  A medium-sized, brown dog runs out, sniffs them all, barks and then runs
  off on the road, disappearing around a <span class="comment">translate:
  Felsvorsprung</span>. A moment later, it comes back, followed by a guy
  wearing a long, dark green coat that has been patched a few times.
  He is wearing a backpack and holds a long staff, using it as a
  <span class="comment">Wanderstab? Cane?</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The stranger says: <span class="quote speech">Good evening!</span><br />
  They greet him back and Michelle and Jack invite him to join them around
  the fire.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Gladly.</span> He comes closer.
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m James, the green wizard of
  Siren&apos;s&nbsp;Edge.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, time traveling witch. Show us some
  of your magic, wizard.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, unfortunately, my staff is broken.</span>
  <br />
  He swings it around and makes some funny noises.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">See? Not working.</span><br />
  They all have a laugh and Annie and Jack introduce themselves in a more
  normal manner.<br />
  Michelle asks:
  <span class="quote speech">What leads you to the area?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I am searching for... &emsp;&emsp; Dora!
  C&apos;mere, sit!</span><br />
  The dog stops sniffing the pot over the fire and returns to James.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">As I was saying, I am looking for pictures
  from the old world like this one...</span><br />
  He shows an old, crumpled photo that, while faded and discolored, still
  clearly depicts a nebula and some stars.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">... and maybe the means to take them.
  I heard there is a quite well-preserved observatory near
  Sentinel&nbsp;Shores.</span><br />
  <span class="comment">This is a new lead for Michelle and Jack.</span>
</p>
<p class="comment">
  Michelle takes the pot off the fire and Jack gets dishes from inside
  the bunker.<br />
  (Some of) The food is unfamiliar to Annie.<br />
  While eating, they discuss their mission.
