<h1>Ran When Parked</h1>

<!--
I started writing this to prepend to the chapter. Not sure where I was
going with this so I'll just leave it in here, commented out.

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">What are the odds it&apos;s just gonna
  work?</span><br />
  Michelle&apos;s eyes wander around the driver&apos;s cabin.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Batteries are dead so it&apos;s not gonna
  start. Will it run? No idea.</span><br />
  Jack pulls a key out of his pocket and inserts it into a key switch on
  the control panel. He turns the key and &ndash; as expected &ndash;
  nothing happens.
  <span class="quote speech">Guess we&apos;ll need to find a power source
  then.</span>
</p>
<p>
  The two roam around the hall, looking for a generator or anything that
  could be abused as one. Michelle makes her way to an area with
  workbenches and all sorts of tools. Jack looks at the crates and boxes on
  the closest one of the huge shelves.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">I ... uhh... found one. No idea how we&apos;re
  gonna get to it though.</span><br />
  Jack stands in front of the shelf, looking at a large crate that&apos;s
  about 2m above him.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Please let that not be the only option.</span>
</p>

<p>
  Michelle pokes her head out from underneath the train.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I think that&apos;s it.</span><br/>
  She puts a large piece of leftover hose aside and crawls out.<br >
  <span class="quote speech">That was quick &ndash; nice job.</span><br />
  Jack walks over to the compartment holding the batteries, takes the
  cables off the terminals, and hooks them up to the generator he had
  turned into a makeshift power supply. He pulls the ripcord and it
  fires right up, then he climbs into the train. Michelle follows him
  and they go to the driver&apos;s cabin. Jack turns a key switch and
  part of the dashboard lights up. Then, he pushes the engine start button.
  The engine begins to turn over. While holding the button, Jack points
  to the fuel pressure gauge, slightly raising his voice to talk over
  the engine:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">That&apos;s progress already.</span><br />
  The needle on the gauge slowly creeps towards the right.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Too slow though</span>, he adds after a
  moment.<br />
  He holds the button for a while, the engine keeps turning over,
  but it doesn&apos;t seem to fire even once.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle suggests they take a look at the fuel injection. Jack turns
  the key switch off again and they go to the middle of the railcar.
  The floor panels above the engine bay are missing, they had removed
  them earlier to replace the bits of rotting hose in the fuel line.
  Jack grabs the manual from one of the seats and starts flipping
  through the pages while Michelle jumps out and stops the generator.
  He begins to undo <span class="comment">knowledge gap here: How
  does that work? What do you undo to fix a gunked-up fuel injection?
  Also, do/did diesel engines have a carb?</span>
</p>
<p>
  After <span class="comment">cleaning out gunk and doing some makeshift
  fix</span>, they try again.
  The engine attempts to start a few times but it still doesn&apos;t run.
  Michelle notices the fuel pressure is back down to zero so they pull
  the line out to see what&apos;s going on. Michelle waits next to
  the train, holding the end of the fuel line over a bucket while Jack
  returns to the driver&apos;s cabin.
  <span class="comment">suggestions for improvements welcome</span>
</p>
<p>
  He presses the button for a few seconds, then he leans out of the window
  looking at Michelle and the bucket. She looks up at him and says:<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Barely a few drips. But there&apos;s pressure
  on the other side of the fuel filter.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m gonna look for a spare.</span><br />
  He walks over to the closest door and jumps out. Michelle begins
  undoing the clamps holding the fuel line to the filter while Jack
  starts searching all drawers and boxes in the vicinity for a
  replacement. One side of the filter comes loose and Michelle starts
  with the other side.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Not the right one but I found this.</span>
  <br />
  Jack holds up a box he found in a drawer. He opens it while walking
  back to Michelle and pulls out a fuel filter that is significantly larger
  than the one pulled from the train. The fuel line fits inside it so they
  add a piece of larger hose over that and put multiple hose clamps around
  both.
</p>
<p>
  Michelle climbs back inside, Jack starts the generator again and follows
  her.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ready?</span> She has her fingers on the
  engine start button.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Go for it.</span><br />
  It takes a while but the engine eventually sputters to life. Michelle
  lets go of the button and it keeps running.
</p>
<p>
  A few hours pass as they fix up a bunch of other small things around
  the train and put the floor panels back in. While climbing around the
  storage shelves in the <span class="comment">hall/hangar?</span>, he
  finds a crate of dried-out lead-acid batteries. After adding some water
  and letting them sit for a while to dissolve the acid, he shoves them
  into the battery compartment and connects the cables.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Michelle, can you turn the switch?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nothing.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">I figured. Let&apos;s see if...</span><br />
  He connects the generator back to the train and starts it.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Start the engine, I&apos;m wanna see
  if we can charge the batteries like this.</span><br />
  With the engine running, he wraps some loose wires around the battery
  terminals and connects them to the generator, causing quite a few sparks
  to fly. The generator&apos;s engine sounds like it&apos;s suddenly
  struggling under heavy load. He yanks the wires out but a few bits of
  them have already fused with the battery terminals.
  <span class="quote speech">Okay, that was truly a room temperature IQ
  move.</span><br />
  He disconnects the train from the generator and waits for a moment
  to see if its engine will continue running without electricity.
  It does, so he forces the lugs onto the battery terminals which now have
  pieces of wire stuck to them.<br />
  Michelle leans out of the window and says:
  <span class="quote speech">The gauge with the battery symbol just dropped
  to the red line.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">If it&apos;s not past it, should be
  fine.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Well, slightly?</span><br />
  Jack climbs into the train and goes to the driver&apos;s cabin.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nah this is fiiiine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  After giving the dashboard a once-over and leaning out of the window
  to check that the train is free to move, he attempts to disengage the
  brakes. Nothing happens. He flips a few switches and a compressor starts
  puttering away under the floor. The next attempt to disengage the brakes
  is met with a lot of hissing from underneath the train, but nothing else
  happens.
