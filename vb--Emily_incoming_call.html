<h1> &lt;Emily incoming call&gt; </h1>

<p class="comment">
  At some point before this chapter, the protagonists need to make phone
  calls happen &ndash; probably from the perspective of those on Earth as
  most of the things in the Lunar Biosphere have been at least kinda
  maintained.

  Emily finds herself laying on the floor, still staring into the sky.
</p>
<p class="light">

</p>
<p>
  She lifts her head.
</p>
<p class="light">

</p>
<p>
  That&apos;s the phone in the control room.

  Emily turns onto her side and slowly gets up. Her back hurts.
</p>
<p class="light">

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">On my way, I&apos;m on my way.</span> she says
  in a soft <span class="comment">matten?</span> voice.
</p>
<p>
  The phone rings a few more times but stops before she can make it there.
  She realizes how thirsty she is and takes a detour to the nearest kitchen.
  She thinks <span class="quote speech">Water! Yes!</span> but her
  excitement quickly turns into disgust as a brown liquid full of clumps
  <span class="comment">sprudelt?</span> from the tap.
</p>
<p>
  After getting water from Tony&apos;s lab and feeding the mice &ndash;
  which she had also neglected to do &ndash; she goes into the main
  control room. The terminal for communication with Earth is lit up,
  showing a message. Emily sits down and writes in response:<br />
  <span class="quote non-speech">Lena is dead.</span>
</p>

<p class="comment">
  She gets up and realizes that she had been completely neglecting her
  bodily needs (food, water, ...) and that her back hurts.

  She starts makeing her way to the main control center, part-way there the
  phone stops ringing. She goes to the nearest bathroom, goes to one of the
  kitchens to grab the next vegetable she can find, and heads to the control
  center to log on at a terminal.
