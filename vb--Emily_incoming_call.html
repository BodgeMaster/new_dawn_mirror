<h1> &lt;Emily incoming call&gt; </h1>
<!-- perspective: Emily -->

<p>
  Emily finds herself lying on the floor, still staring into the sky.
  She has no idea how long she had been laying here, but it must have been
  many hours.
</p>
<p class="light">
  drrrrrrrrinnng
</p>
<p>
  She lifts her head.
</p>
<p class="light">

</p>
<p>
  That&apos;s the phone in the control room. Earth people are calling.
</p>
<p class="light">
  drrrrrrrrinnng
</p>
<p>
  She turns onto her side and slowly gets up. Her back hurts and she feels
  weak from hunger.
</p>
<p class="light">

<p>
  <span class="quote speech">On my way, I&apos;m on my way.</span> she
  says in a soft, faint voice as she starts walking. The phone rings a few
  more times but stops before she can make it there. She enters the main
  control room and heads over to the communications section where she finds
  the terminal lit up. She sits down and, without reading the message
  there, starts typing.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">
<span class="blur">Incoming connection. This is blurred text. You shouldn&apos;t be able to read it.</span>
<span class="blur">To reward your curiosity, Michelle has the following message:</span>
<span class="blur">MICHELLE @ EARTH-53 <b>&gt;</b> Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down</span>

  Emily gets up and leaves the control room towards the nearest kitchen.
  Once there, she realizes how thirsty she is and goes directly
  for the sink. She opens the tap and hears the pump under the floor
  kick in, but no water comes out. Dismayed, she closes the tap and
  looks around. Her eyes wander to the door &ndash; Tony&apos;s lab is
  just down the hall, she&apos;s gonna try her luck there.
</p>
<p>
  Standing in front of the sink, she reaches for a beaker on the drying
  rack. She hesitates for a moment before grabbing one. With the other
  hand, she opens the tap. It starts spitting a brown liquid with clumps.
  <span class="quote speech">Ugh.</span> She opens it up fully and waits
  for the water to clear up &ndash; and then waits a bit longer just to be
  sure. Finally, she fills up the beaker and takes a cautious sip.
  Tastes fine.
</p>
<p>
  After downing roughly half a liter of water, her attention turns to the
  mice, which she had neglected just like herself. She feeds them and gives
  them fresh water, then she fills up the beaker again and leaves for the
  kitchen.
