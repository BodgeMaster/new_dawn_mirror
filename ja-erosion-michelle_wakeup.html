<h1>Erosion</h1>
<p>
  <span class="quote speech">Morning Michelle!</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Ugh.</span><br />
  She takes a step out of her preservation chamber, sits down on the floor
  with her arms over her knees, and rests her head on them.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">I&apos;m gonna ... need a moment.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Water?</span><br />
  She lifts her head. Jack hands her a glass. She takes a couple sips before
  setting it down and resting her head again.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">Not sure if that makes it better or worse.
  Just let me sit here for a moment.</span><br />
  After a while, she lifts her head again.<br />
  <span class="quote speech">So what&apos;s our mission?</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nothing. Uplink&apos;s dead.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">What... What happened? What year is it?</span>
  <br />
  <span class="quote speech">Twenty-one-oh-six.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">You&apos;re kidding me.</span><br />
  <span class="quote speech">Nope. ... As for what happened to the uplink,
  I can&apos;t tell you. I&apos;ve spent the past <span class="comment">
  idk what amount of time</span> trapped in here.</span><br />
  Jack recounts the recent events as well as some of the things he had read
  about in the logs.
